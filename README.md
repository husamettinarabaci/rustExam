# rustExam

Learn Rust by solving  progressively harder questions, from beginner syntax to advanced concurrency.

## ðŸš€ What is this?

This is a structured, open-source Rust challenge that helps you master Rust through practice â€“ one question at a time.

Each question includes:
- Topic-based sections
- Real code snippets
- Markdown-exportable Q&A blocks
