#### âœ… Answer 852: Using MIR borrow checker diagnostics

The MIR borrow checker operates on Rustâ€™s Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR) and provides more precise analysis than the classic borrow checker. This allows some valid code to compile and catches more complex borrowing errors.

For example, the following code would error with the classic borrow checker but compiles with the MIR borrow checker:

```rust
let mut x = 5;
let y = &mut x;
*y += 1;
println!("{}", x); // x can be used again
```

The MIR borrow checker more accurately determines borrow scopes and reduces false positives.
