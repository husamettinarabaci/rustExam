#### âœ… Answer 853: Using static analysis tools for Rust

Static analysis tools like Clippy and rust-analyzer help improve code quality and safety in Rust projects. Clippy provides warnings for code smells and potential errors.

Basic usage:

```sh
cargo clippy
```

Example output:
```
warning: this let-binding can be replaced by a direct assignment
 --> src/main.rs:2:5
```

These tools help make code safer and more readable.
