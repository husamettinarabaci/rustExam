In Rust, procedural and declarative macros can be used together. Declarative macros (`macro_rules!`) are great for simple code patterns, while procedural macros are used for more complex code generation. Below is an example where a declarative macro calls a procedural macro, demonstrating how both macro types can be combined.

First, you need to create a procedural macro crate. In your main crate, you can use both macro types together.

```rust
// proc_macros/src/lib.rs
use proc_macro::TokenStream;

#[proc_macro]
pub fn make_hello(_item: TokenStream) -> TokenStream {
    "println!(\"Hello from procedural macro!\");".parse().unwrap()
}
```

```rust
// main.rs or main crate
use proc_macros::make_hello;

macro_rules! call_proc_macro {
    () => {
        make_hello!();
    };
}

fn main() {
    call_proc_macro!();
}
```

In this example, the declarative macro `call_proc_macro!` calls the procedural macro `make_hello!`. This shows how both macro types can be used together in Rust.
