#### âœ… Answer 566: Managing peripheral clocks and power states

Peripheral clocks and power management are critical for energy efficiency and timing accuracy. In Rust, these are typically managed via HAL libraries. Example:

```rust
// Clock configuration (example, depends on hardware and HAL)
let rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();
let clocks = rcc.cfgr.sysclk(48.mhz()).freeze();

// Entering low-power mode (example)
dp.PWR.enter_low_power_mode();
```
This code sets the clock frequency and demonstrates entering a low-power mode.
