Concurrency in embedded systems can lead to data races and deadlocks. In Rust, safety is ensured using constructs like `Mutex` and `CriticalSection`. Example:

```rust
use cortex_m::interrupt::{free, CriticalSection};

static mut SHARED: u32 = 0;

fn safe_increment(cs: &CriticalSection) {
    unsafe { SHARED += 1; }
}

free(|cs| {
    safe_increment(cs);
});
```
This code uses a critical section for safe access.
