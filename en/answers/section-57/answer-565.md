DMA allows data transfer without CPU intervention. In Rust, DMA transfers are typically managed via HAL libraries. Basic steps:

1. Configure the DMA channel.
2. Specify source and destination buffers.
3. Start the DMA transfer.

Example (abstract):
```rust
// DMA start example (actual hardware-specific code may differ)
let dma = dp.DMA1.split();
dma.channel1.start_transfer(&src_buffer, &mut dst_buffer);
```
During this process, the CPU can perform other tasks.
