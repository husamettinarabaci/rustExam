#### âœ… Answer 568: Implementing real-time scheduling policies

Real-time schedulers ensure tasks run at specific times. In Rust, frameworks like RTIC allow you to implement task priorities and scheduling policies. Example:

```rust
// Using RTIC framework for prioritized tasks
#[rtic::app(device = stm32f4xx_hal::pac)]
mod app {
    #[task(priority = 2)]
    fn high_priority_task(_cx: high_priority_task::Context) {}

    #[task(priority = 1)]
    fn low_priority_task(_cx: low_priority_task::Context) {}
}
```
This code defines high and low priority tasks.
