#### âœ… Answer 596: Building a user-space file system (FUSE)

For a FUSE-based file system in Rust, use the fuse crate. Here is a basic skeleton (for illustration):

```rust
use fuse::{Filesystem, Request, ReplyAttr, ReplyEntry, ReplyData, ReplyWrite};
use libc::ENOENT;
use std::ffi::OsStr;
use std::time::{Duration, SystemTime};

struct MyFS;

impl Filesystem for MyFS {
    // Implement required methods (lookup, getattr, read, write, etc.)
}

fn main() {
    let mountpoint = "/tmp/myfs";
    fuse::mount(MyFS, &mountpoint, &[]).unwrap();
}
```
