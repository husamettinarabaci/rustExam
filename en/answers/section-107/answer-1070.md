#### âœ… Answer 1070: Designing resilient concurrent systems

Resilient concurrent systems should have features like fault tolerance, automatic recovery, and restart capabilities. In Rust, you can use panic catching (`std::panic::catch_unwind`), thread restarts, and error logging.

Example:
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        panic!("Something went wrong!");
    });
    if let Err(_) = handle.join() {
        println!("Thread crashed, restarting...");
        // You could start a new thread here
    }
    // Add automatic recovery and logging as needed
}
```
Such systems should monitor errors and be able to recover automatically.
