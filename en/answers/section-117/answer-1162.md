#### âœ… Answer 1162: Understanding OS thread scheduling

In Rust, threads are typically mapped to operating system (OS) threads. Thread scheduling determines when and for how long threads run on the CPU. Threads created with Rust's `std::thread` API are managed by the OS scheduler. Thread priority determines how likely a thread is to run compared to others, while a time slice is the maximum uninterrupted time a thread can run on the CPU. Rust does not directly control thread priority or time slice; these are managed by the OS.
