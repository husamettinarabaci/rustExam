#### âœ… Answer 60: Function with side effects

This function demonstrates a side effect by printing to the console. Side effects are actions that affect the outside world or program state, such as I/O or modifying static variables.

```rust
fn print_message() {
    println!("This function has a side effect: it prints to the console.");
}

fn main() {
    print_message();
}
```
