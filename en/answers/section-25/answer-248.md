#### âœ… Answer 248: Closures and async functions

In Rust, you can use closures with async functions by passing them as parameters. If the closure itself is async, you can use `Fn() -> impl Future`. Here is an example using `tokio`:

```rust
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;
use std::future::Future;

async fn run_with_closure<F, Fut>(f: F)
where
    F: Fn() -> Fut,
    Fut: Future<Output = ()>,
{
    f().await;
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let closure = || async {
        println!("Hello from async closure!");
    };
    run_with_closure(closure).await;
}
```

This example defines an async function `run_with_closure` that takes a closure returning a future. The closure is called and awaited inside the function. The `tokio` runtime is used to run the async code.
