#### âœ… Answer 884: Hardware timers and interrupts for concurrency

Hardware timers generate interrupts at set intervals, triggering periodic tasks. Interrupts are handled by priority and can cause race conditions.

Example: Toggling an LED with a timer interrupt:

```rust
#[interrupt]
fn TIM2() {
    // Toggle LED state
}

fn main() {
    // Start TIM2 timer and enable its interrupt
}
```

Interrupts allow high-priority tasks to run quickly. Use critical sections to prevent race conditions.
