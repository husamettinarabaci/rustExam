Integrating an RTOS provides task management, scheduling, and resource sharing, but introduces FFI and memory safety challenges.

Example of starting a task with FreeRTOS:

```rust
use freertos_rs::*;

fn main() {
    let task = Task::new().name("hello").start(|| {
        loop {
            // Task code
        }
    });
    FreeRtosUtils::start_scheduler();
}
```

When using an RTOS API from Rust, pay attention to memory management and FFI safety.
