Concurrency bugs manifest as unexpected data changes, deadlocks, or inconsistencies. Tools like semihosting, RTT, and logging can help debug these issues.

Example using assert to detect a race condition:

```rust
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
static COUNTER: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);

fn increment() {
    let prev = COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
    // Error if value is out of expected range
    assert!(prev < 100, "Race condition detected!");
}
```

This code triggers an assertion if an unexpected counter value is detected.
