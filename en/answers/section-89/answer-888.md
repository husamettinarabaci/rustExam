#### âœ… Answer 888: DMA buffer management

DMA allows data transfer without occupying the CPU, improving performance and freeing the processor. Proper buffer alignment and lifetime management are crucial.

Example of safe DMA buffer management:

```rust
static mut BUFFER: [u8; 1024] = [0; 1024];

fn start_dma_transfer() {
    // Provide DMA with the address and size of BUFFER
    // Use an interrupt to signal DMA completion
}
```

For safe DMA, ensure the buffer is static or has an appropriate lifetime, and prevent data races.
