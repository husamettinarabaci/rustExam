Lock-free data structures allow data sharing without locks, using atomic operations. This reduces latency and eliminates deadlocks in real-time systems, but can introduce race conditions and ABA problems in complex scenarios.

Example of an atomic counter:

```rust
use core::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
static COUNTER: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);

fn increment() {
    COUNTER.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
}

fn get() -> usize {
    COUNTER.load(Ordering::SeqCst)
}
```

Lock-free structures are preferred in real-time systems for fast, uninterrupted access.
