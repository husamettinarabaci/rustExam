#### âœ… Answer 889: Concurrent implementation of communication protocols

Concurrent protocol implementation prevents data loss and enables real-time communication. When exchanging data between tasks or interrupts, race conditions must be avoided.

Example: UART data exchange between two tasks:

```rust
// Task 1: Send data over UART
fn task1() {
    // uart.write(b"Hello");
}
// Task 2: Receive data over UART
fn task2() {
    // let data = uart.read();
}
```

Use atomic operations or critical sections to protect shared buffers and ensure data integrity.
