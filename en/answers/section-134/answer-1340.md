#### âœ… Answer 1340: Packaging and deployment best practices

WASM applications require optimized binaries and assets for the browser, so special packaging and deployment processes are needed. In the Rust ecosystem, tools like `wasm-pack` and `trunk` simplify this.

For example, to package a Leptos or Yew project with `trunk`:

```sh
trunk build --release
```

This command outputs optimized WASM and assets to the `dist/` folder. For deployment, upload this folder to a static server or CDN.

Best practices:
- Build in release mode for smaller WASM size.
- Exclude unnecessary files from deployment.
- Use a CDN or fast static server.
- Serve with HTTPS and correct MIME types.
