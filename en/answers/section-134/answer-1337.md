Accessibility (a11y) ensures that users with disabilities can use your application, which is important for inclusivity and legal compliance. Keyboard navigation is essential for users who cannot use a mouse. In Rust WASM UI frameworks, accessibility can be improved with semantic HTML and ARIA labels.

Below is a Yew example of a button that can be focused and activated with the Enter key:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

#[function_component(AccessibleButton)]
fn accessible_button() -> Html {
    let onclick = Callback::from(|_| web_sys::console::log_1(&"Clicked!".into()));
    let onkeydown = Callback::from(|e: KeyboardEvent| {
        if e.key() == "Enter" {
            web_sys::console::log_1(&"Activated with Enter!".into());
        }
    });
    html! {
        <button aria-label="Accessible Button" tabindex="0" {onclick} {onkeydown}>
            {"Accessible Button"}
        </button>
    }
}
```

This button can be activated by mouse or keyboard, and the ARIA label improves accessibility.
