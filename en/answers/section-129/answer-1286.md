#### âœ… Answer 1286: Optimizing WASM bundle size and load times

This task applies several optimization techniques to reduce the size and load time of a Rust WASM application. Use the `--release` flag during build, remove unnecessary dependencies, and minify the output with `wasm-opt`.

```rust
// Build with optimizations:
// wasm-pack build --release

// Minify with wasm-opt:
// wasm-opt -Oz -o optimized.wasm pkg/your_project_bg.wasm

// Export only needed functions:
#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn only_needed() { /* ... */ }
```
