#### âœ… Answer 20: Using basic numeric types (i32, u32, f64, etc.)

**Explanation:**

Rust supports several numeric types, including signed and unsigned integers and floating-point numbers.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a: i32 = -10;
    let b: u32 = 20;
    let c: f64 = 3.14;
    println!("i32: {}", a);
    println!("u32: {}", b);
    println!("f64: {}", c);
}
```
