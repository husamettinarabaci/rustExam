Secret and configuration management is critical to prevent sensitive data leaks. In Rust microservices, Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMap are used to securely manage such information.

Below is a sample YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-secret
stringData:
  password: supersecret
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
  labels:
    app: rust-microservice
  data:
    RUST_LOG: info
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rust-microservice
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: rust-microservice
          image: myrepo/rust-microservice:latest
          env:
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: db-secret
                  key: password
            - name: RUST_LOG
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: app-config
                  key: RUST_LOG
```
This configuration securely injects the password and log level into the container.
