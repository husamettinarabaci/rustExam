An embedded operating system (OS) is designed for resource-constrained devices, often with real-time requirements. Key features include task scheduling, interrupt handling, and minimal memory usage. Embedded OSes must be reliable and deterministic. Examples include FreeRTOS, Zephyr, and Tock OS, all of which have Rust support or bindings. Rust's safety and concurrency features make it well-suited for embedded OS development.
