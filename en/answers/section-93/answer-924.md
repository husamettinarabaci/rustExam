#### âœ… Answer 924: Memory protection and MPU usage

Memory protection prevents tasks from accessing unauthorized memory regions, improving system safety. An MPU (Memory Protection Unit) enforces access rules for different memory regions. In Rust, you can use crates like `cortex-m` and `cortex-m-rt` to configure the MPU on ARM Cortex-M devices. Example: configuring an MPU region for a task stack. Always consult your device's reference manual and use safe abstractions where possible.
