Power management reduces energy consumption in embedded devices. Techniques include sleep modes, disabling unused peripherals, and dynamic frequency scaling. In Rust, HAL crates often provide APIs to control power states. Example: putting a microcontroller into sleep mode using a HAL method. Efficient power management extends battery life and reduces heat in embedded systems.
