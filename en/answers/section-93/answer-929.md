#### âœ… Answer 929: Debugging embedded OS kernels

Debugging embedded OS kernels involves techniques like semihosting, RTT (Real-Time Transfer), serial output, and hardware debuggers (e.g., JTAG, SWD). Rust tools like `probe-rs` and `defmt` enable efficient logging and debugging. Example: using `defmt::info!()` for real-time logging. Hardware debuggers allow breakpoints and memory inspection, which are essential for kernel development.
