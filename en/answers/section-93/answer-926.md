Rust can be integrated with FreeRTOS or Zephyr via FFI (Foreign Function Interface) or Rust bindings. Benefits include memory safety and modern language features; challenges involve toolchain compatibility and FFI safety. Crates like `freertos-rust` and `zephyr-sys` provide bindings. Example: use `freertos-rust` to create tasks and synchronize with FreeRTOS primitives. Always ensure ABI compatibility and test thoroughly.
