#### âœ… Answer 930: Testing real-time embedded systems

Testing real-time embedded systems is challenging due to strict timing and determinism requirements. Strategies include hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, simulation, and property-based testing. Rust crates like `proptest` and `embedded-hal-mock` help simulate hardware and test logic. Use precise timers and measure response times to ensure real-time constraints are met.
