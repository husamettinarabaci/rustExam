#### âœ… Answer 925: Real-time constraints and deadlines

Real-time constraints require tasks to complete within specific time limits. Hard real-time means missing a deadline is unacceptable; soft real-time allows occasional misses. RTOSes manage deadlines via priority scheduling and timers. In Rust, crates like `rtic` (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency) help structure real-time applications. Rust's safety and predictability support reliable real-time systems.
