#### âœ… Answer 792: Kernel module concepts and Rust

A kernel module is a piece of code that can be loaded into the OS kernel at runtime, extending its functionality. Rust can be used for kernel modules, offering memory safety and modern abstractions. However, Rust requires `no_std`, careful use of `unsafe`, and may lack some low-level features compared to C. Projects like `rust-for-linux` are making Rust kernel modules more practical.
