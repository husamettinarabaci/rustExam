A simple filesystem consists of components like a superblock, inodes, and directories. In Rust, these can be represented as structs. Read/write operations are implemented as methods.

```rust
struct Superblock { /* ... */ }
struct Inode { /* ... */ }
struct Directory { /* ... */ }

impl Inode {
    fn read(&self) -> Vec<u8> { /* ... */ vec![] }
    fn write(&mut self, data: &[u8]) { /* ... */ }
}
```
This modular approach makes the code safe and maintainable.
