A networking stack is divided into layers: physical, data link, network, and transport. Each layer can be modeled as a trait or struct in Rust. For example, a simple transport layer:

```rust
trait TransportLayer {
    fn send(&self, data: &[u8]);
    fn receive(&self) -> Vec<u8>;
}
```
This abstraction allows for modular protocol implementations.
