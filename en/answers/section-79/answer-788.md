#### âœ… Answer 788: Packaging and deploying WASM applications

To package and deploy WASM applications, use tools like `wasm-pack` or `trunk`. These tools compile Rust code, generate JS bindings, and produce a deployable package. The output can be uploaded to a CDN or server with static files.

```sh
wasm-pack build --target web
# or
trunk build --release
```
