#### âœ… Answer 789: Security considerations for WASM

For WASM security, enforce memory limits, prevent unauthorized access, and use safe APIs. Rust's type safety and ownership model help prevent memory errors. Additionally, run WASM modules in a sandboxed environment for isolation.

```rust
// WASM modules are sandboxed by default
// Add safe APIs and access controls as needed
```
