#### âœ… Answer 1372: Optimizing memory usage in WASM

To optimize memory in WASM, avoid unnecessary allocations in your Rust code and pre-allocate data structures when possible. Using a lightweight allocator like `wee_alloc` can also help.

```rust
// In Cargo.toml:
// [dependencies]
// wee_alloc = "0.4"

#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: wee_alloc::WeeAlloc = wee_alloc::WeeAlloc::INIT;
```

- Manage references properly to avoid leaks.
- Use `wasm-bindgen` and browser tools to monitor memory usage.
