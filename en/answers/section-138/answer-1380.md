#### âœ… Answer 1380: Automated testing of WASM components

Automated testing is crucial for catching bugs early and ensuring reliability in WASM components. For Rust-based WASM modules, tests can be implemented as follows:

- **Unit Tests:** Use Rust's standard test framework (`#[cfg(test)]`, `#[test]`) to test module logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests for browser or Node.js environments using tools like `wasm-bindgen-test`.
- **Testing Tools:**
  - `wasm-bindgen-test`: Automates unit and integration tests for WASM.
  - `wasmtime`, `wasmer`: Useful for testing server-side WASM modules.
  - `cargo test`: Allows running tests for Rust code compiled to the WASM target.

These tools help ensure WASM components are reliable both during development and before deployment.
