#### âœ… Answer 1377: Integrating WASM with browser APIs efficiently

To use browser APIs in a WASM module, use crates like `wasm-bindgen` and `web-sys`/`js-sys`. These are needed for DOM manipulation or fetch requests.

- For performance, prefer types like `Uint8Array` for large data transfers.
- For security, always validate user input.

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;
use web_sys::window;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn show_alert() {
    window().unwrap().alert_with_message("Hello from WASM!").unwrap();
}
```
