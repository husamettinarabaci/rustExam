#### âœ… Answer 1378: Detecting and fixing memory leaks in WASM

To detect memory leaks, use the "Memory" tab in browser developer tools. In Rust, avoid unnecessary references and cyclic data structures.

- Be careful with types like `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.
- Compare heap snapshots to find leaks.
- Use the `drop` function in Rust when needed to free resources.
