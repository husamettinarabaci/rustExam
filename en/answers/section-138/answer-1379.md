Although WASM modules run in a sandboxed environment, they still pose certain security risks. To ensure secure distribution and execution of WASM modules, follow these best practices:

- **Limit Permissions:** Grant the WASM module access only to the resources it needs. In the browser, restrict available APIs.
- **Source Validation:** Only load and execute WASM modules from trusted sources. Use hashes or signatures to verify module integrity.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update the WASM runtime and dependencies.
- **Thorough Testing and Analysis:** Perform static analysis and security testing before deploying modules.
- **Server-Side Precautions:** When running WASM on the server, restrict access to the file system, network, and other sensitive resources.
- **Browser Security:** Use CORS, CSP, and other security headers to ensure modules are loaded only from allowed origins.

These measures help ensure WASM modules run securely on both client and server sides.
