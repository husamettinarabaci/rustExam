#### âœ… Answer 579: Tools and editors support for Rust games

Tools and editors accelerate and simplify game development. Tools built with Rust are safe, fast, and portable. For example, you can use `egui` to build a simple level editor:

```rust
use eframe::egui;

fn main() {
    eframe::run_native(
        "Level Editor",
        eframe::NativeOptions::default(),
        Box::new(|_cc| Box::new(MyApp::default())),
    );
}
// You can build the UI in the MyApp struct using egui.
```
