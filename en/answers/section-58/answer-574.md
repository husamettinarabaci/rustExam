#### âœ… Answer 574: Handling multi-threaded rendering and updates

Multithreaded rendering and updates improve performance by distributing work (e.g., physics, rendering, AI) across threads. In Rust, you can use `std::thread` for basic parallel updates:

```rust
use std::thread;

let handles: Vec<_> = (0..4).map(|i| {
    thread::spawn(move || {
        // Each thread does its work
        println!("Thread {} running", i);
    })
}).collect();
for h in handles { h.join().unwrap(); }
```
