#### âœ… Answer 572: Implementing spatial partitioning (quadtrees, octrees)

Spatial partitioning helps efficiently manage objects and speed up operations like collision detection in game engines. Quadtrees (2D) and octrees (3D) divide space hierarchically. A basic quadtree in Rust can be defined as:

```rust
struct Rect { x: f32, y: f32, w: f32, h: f32 }
struct Quadtree {
    boundary: Rect,
    points: Vec<(f32, f32)>,
    children: Option<[Box<Quadtree>; 4]>,
}
// Objects are subdivided into child nodes based on their position.
```
