#### âœ… Answer 580: Profiling and optimizing game loops

The game loop keeps the game running and updating. Profiling helps identify bottlenecks and guide optimization. In Rust, you can profile a game loop by timing its execution:

```rust
use std::time::Instant;

let start = Instant::now();
for _ in 0..100 {
    // Game logic
}
let duration = start.elapsed();
println!("Loop duration: {:?}", duration);
```
