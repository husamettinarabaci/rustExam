#### âœ… Answer 578: Scripting integration with Lua or WASM

Scripting integration allows dynamic modification of game behavior. Lua is popular for rapid prototyping, while WASM offers language independence. In Rust, you can use `rlua` for Lua integration:

```rust
use rlua::Lua;
let lua = Lua::new();
lua.context(|ctx| {
    ctx.load("print('Hello from Lua!')").exec().unwrap();
});
```
// For WASM, crates like `wasmtime` can be used.
