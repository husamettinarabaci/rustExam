This example outlines how to use `tokio-rustls` to create a TLS-enabled async TCP server and client. In a real application, certificate and key files are required.

```rust
// Server (outline)
use tokio_rustls::TlsAcceptor;
// ...load certificate and key...
// Accept connections with TcpListener, wrap with TlsAcceptor
// Perform async read/write operations
```

```rust
// Client (outline)
use tokio_rustls::TlsConnector;
// ...certificate validation and connection code...
// Connect with TcpStream, wrap with TlsConnector
// Send message and read response
```

> Note: See the tokio-rustls documentation for a full example. Certificate and key files are required.
