One of the most common lifetime errors in Rust is trying to return a reference to a local variable from a function. The compiler will typically give an error like "reference does not live long enough" or "missing lifetime specifier".

In the following example, the function tries to return a reference to a local variable:

```rust
// Incorrect code:
fn get_ref() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    &s
} // s is dropped here, reference becomes invalid

// Error: "returns a reference to data owned by the current function"

// Correct code:
fn get_owned() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    s
} // Ownership is returned, no lifetime issue
```

In the first code, `s` is dropped when the function ends, making the reference invalid. The correct solution is to return ownership instead of a reference.
