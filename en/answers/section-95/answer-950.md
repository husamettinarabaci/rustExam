In large Rust codebases, compile-time reflection is used to reduce boilerplate, automate code generation, and improve maintainability. Procedural macros and derive mechanisms can automatically generate trait implementations or additional code for data structures, which is especially useful when many similar types exist. However, macros can introduce complexity, make debugging harder, and increase compile times. In practice, libraries like serde use `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` to automate serialization logic across large projects.

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct User {
    id: u32,
    name: String,
}
// Compile-time macro generates serialization/deserialization code automatically.
```
