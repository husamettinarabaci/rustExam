#### âœ… Answer 943: Implementing compile-time code generation

Compile-time code generation is the process of producing code during compilation, reducing boilerplate and enabling advanced patterns. Rust supports this via declarative macros (`macro_rules!`) and procedural macros.

Example: Declarative macro generating getter functions:

```rust
macro_rules! make_getter {
    ($name:ident, $field:ident) => {
        fn $name(&self) -> &str {
            &self.$field
        }
    };
}

struct User {
    name: String,
}

impl User {
    make_getter!(get_name, name);
}
```

Use cases: repetitive code, trait implementations, serialization. Pitfalls: harder debugging, cryptic errors, and increased compile times. Use macros judiciously for maintainable code.
