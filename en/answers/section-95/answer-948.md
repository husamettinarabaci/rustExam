#### âœ… Answer 948: Exploring experimental reflection crates

Several experimental crates attempt to provide reflection in Rust, such as `inventory`, `traitobject`, and `reflect`.

- `inventory`: Enables registration of types or functions at compile time for later discovery, useful for plugin systems.
- `traitobject`: Provides limited dynamic trait object manipulation.
- `reflect`: Offers compile-time reflection-like APIs, but not full runtime reflection.

Limitations: These crates cannot provide full runtime type inspection or modification as in Java or C#. They are best for plugin registries, dynamic dispatch, or code generation, but not for general-purpose reflection. Use with caution, as APIs may be unstable or nightly-only.
