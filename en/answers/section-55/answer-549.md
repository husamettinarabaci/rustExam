#### âœ… Answer 549: Building a minimal kernel module interface (conceptual)

Building a kernel module interface in Rust requires low-level system programming. Typically, you define entry/exit functions for loading and unloading the module. Unsafe code and platform-specific APIs are required for safety and compatibility.

```rust
// This code is conceptual and for Linux kernel; it will not compile as-is.
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn init_module() -> i32 {
    // Called when the module is loaded
    0
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn cleanup_module() {
    // Called when the module is unloaded
}
```

Real kernel modules require Rust nightly and special toolchains. Unsafe blocks and platform-specific APIs are mandatory for safety.
