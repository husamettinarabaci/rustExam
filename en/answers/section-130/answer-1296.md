#### âœ… Answer 1296: Securing microservices with mTLS

mTLS ensures secure communication by authenticating both client and server. In Rust, mTLS is typically implemented using TLS-enabled libraries (e.g., tonic, hyper). Certificates should be renewed automatically and stored securely. Service mesh solutions can automate mTLS management, reducing the need for custom code in services.

```rust
// Example of enabling mTLS with tonic
Server::builder()
  .tls_config(tls_config)?
  .add_service(...)
  .serve(addr)
  .await?;
```
