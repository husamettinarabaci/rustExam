#### âœ… Answer 1294: Implementing service mesh concepts

A service mesh provides a transparent layer to manage inter-service communication, offering monitoring, security, load balancing, and traffic routing. Rust services are typically integrated with the mesh via a sidecar proxy (e.g., Envoy). The sidecar manages all traffic between the app and the network, enabling mesh features without requiring changes to the Rust service code.

```rust
// No special code is needed in the Rust service for mesh operation
// All traffic is routed through the sidecar proxy (e.g., Envoy)
```
