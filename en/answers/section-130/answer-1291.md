#### âœ… Answer 1291: Designing microservices with Rust and gRPC

Rust microservices allow each service to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. gRPC provides fast, type-safe RPC communication. Each service should have its own data model and business logic, communicating via protocols defined in gRPC. Loose coupling, clear API definitions, and decentralized state management are essential for independence and scalability.

```rust
// Example gRPC service definition (proto file):
syntax = "proto3";

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser (UserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
}
```
