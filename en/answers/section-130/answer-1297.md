#### âœ… Answer 1297: Managing configuration with `config` crate

The `config` crate allows flexible configuration in Rust applications by merging JSON, YAML, or TOML files and environment variables for different environments. Configurations are loaded at startup and used in a type-safe way. Secure configuration is critical for protecting sensitive data and ensuring reliable operation.

```rust
use config::Config;
let settings = Config::builder()
    .add_source(config::File::with_name("Settings"))
    .add_source(config::Environment::default())
    .build()?;
```
