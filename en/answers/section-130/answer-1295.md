#### âœ… Answer 1295: Distributed tracing and telemetry

In Rust microservices, tools like OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, and Prometheus can be used for distributed tracing. Telemetry data can be automatically collected during inter-service calls and sent to a central system. OpenTelemetry provides a standard API for tracing, metrics, and logging, and is supported in the Rust ecosystem.

```rust
// Example of starting tracing with OpenTelemetry
use opentelemetry::global;
global::set_text_map_propagator(...);
```
