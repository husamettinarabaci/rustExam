#### âœ… Answer 1494: Managing breaking changes gracefully

To manage breaking changes in Rust projects with minimal disruption:

- Announce changes in advance and provide clear migration guides.
- Use deprecation warnings before removing features.
- Bump the major version in `Cargo.toml` following semantic versioning.
- Document all changes in the changelog and release notes.
- Offer transitional APIs or feature flags to ease migration.

This approach helps maintain user trust and project stability during major updates.

```rust
#[deprecated(note = "Use new_function instead")]
pub fn old_function() {
    // ...
}
```
