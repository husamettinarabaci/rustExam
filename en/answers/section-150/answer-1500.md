For long-term maintainability and scalability in Rust projects:

- Use modular, well-documented code and clear APIs.
- Write tests and use CI to catch regressions early.
- Monitor and refactor to manage technical debt.
- Design for extensibility and performance from the start.
- Regularly review dependencies and update as needed.
- Foster a collaborative, learning-focused team culture.

This checklist helps ensure your Rust project can grow sustainably and adapt to future needs.

```rust
// Example: Modular code structure
mod api;
mod core;
mod utils;
```
