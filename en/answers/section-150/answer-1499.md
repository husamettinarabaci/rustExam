To safely adopt new Rust language features:

- Track new features in release notes and RFCs.
- Test new features in isolated branches or behind feature flags.
- Use CI to validate changes across supported toolchains.
- Roll out changes incrementally and monitor for regressions.
- Balance innovation with stability by limiting new features in critical code paths until proven stable.

This process helps you benefit from new Rust capabilities while minimizing risk to production systems.

```rust
// Example: Use a new feature behind a feature flag
#[cfg(feature = "new_feature")]
pub fn use_new_feature() {
    // ...
}
```
