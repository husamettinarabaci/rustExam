#### âœ… Answer 1492: Using feature flags for gradual adoption

Feature flags in Rust allow you to enable or disable code at compile time, making it easier to adopt new features incrementally.

- Define feature flags in your `Cargo.toml` under the `[features]` section.
- Use `#[cfg(feature = "flag_name")]` in your code to conditionally compile code blocks.
- Feature flags help test new features, maintain backward compatibility, and reduce risk during migration.
- In large projects, document feature flags, use clear naming, and remove obsolete flags regularly to avoid complexity.

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[features]
new_api = []
```

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "new_api")]
pub fn new_functionality() {
    // ...
}
```
