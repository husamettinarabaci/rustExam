#### âœ… Answer 1496: Designing extensible and modular crates

To design extensible and modular Rust crates:

- Organize code into clear modules and use public APIs thoughtfully.
- Expose traits for extensibility and allow users to implement them.
- Use feature flags to enable optional functionality.
- Avoid tight coupling between modules; prefer dependency injection and trait objects.
- Write comprehensive documentation and examples for extension points.

This ensures your crate can be easily extended, reused, and maintained as requirements evolve.

```rust
// Example: Exposing a trait for extensibility
pub trait Formatter {
    fn format(&self, input: &str) -> String;
}
```
