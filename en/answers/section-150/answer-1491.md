#### âœ… Answer 1491: Designing for Rust edition migrations

To ensure a Rust project can be smoothly migrated between editions, follow these best practices:

- Regularly run `cargo fix --edition` to prepare for new edition lints.
- Avoid using deprecated or edition-specific features that may be removed or changed.
- Keep dependencies up to date, as older crates may not support new editions.
- Use continuous integration to test with the latest stable and beta Rust toolchains.
- Document any edition-specific code or workarounds in comments.

By proactively addressing edition warnings and maintaining clean, idiomatic code, you can minimize migration effort and ensure your codebase remains compatible with future Rust editions.

```rust
// Example: Run this to prepare for edition changes
// $ cargo fix --edition
```
