#### âœ… Answer 1493: Abstracting over unstable and experimental features

To safely use unstable or experimental features in Rust, isolate them behind feature flags and conditional compilation. This allows you to provide stable fallbacks and maintain compatibility with stable Rust.

- Use `#[cfg(feature = "unstable")]` to enable experimental code only when the feature is active.
- Provide alternative implementations for stable builds.
- Keep unstable code in separate modules or files for clarity.

This pattern lets you test new features without breaking stable builds and makes future upgrades easier.

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "unstable")]
pub fn new_api() {
    // Unstable implementation
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "unstable"))]
pub fn new_api() {
    // Stable fallback
}
```
