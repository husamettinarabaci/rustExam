#### âœ… Answer 1495: Preparing for async ecosystem evolutions

To future-proof async Rust projects:

- Minimize direct dependencies on specific async runtimes (e.g., Tokio, async-std).
- Use traits and generic abstractions (like `async_trait`) to decouple code from runtime details.
- Prefer standard library futures and traits where possible.
- Isolate runtime-specific code in modules or behind feature flags.
- Monitor ecosystem changes and test with new runtimes early.

This approach makes it easier to migrate to new async features or runtimes as the ecosystem evolves.

```rust
// Example: Use async_trait for runtime-agnostic async traits
#[async_trait::async_trait]
pub trait MyAsyncTrait {
    async fn do_work(&self);
}
```
