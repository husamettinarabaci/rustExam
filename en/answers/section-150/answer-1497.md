To maintain long-term health in Rust projects, set up CI with these practices:

- Automate tests with `cargo test` on every commit and pull request.
- Run `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo clippy` for formatting and linting.
- Use tools like `cargo audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies.
- Test against multiple Rust toolchain versions (stable, beta, nightly).
- Keep CI pipelines fast by caching dependencies and running jobs in parallel.

Example (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: cargo test --all
- name: Lint
  run: cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings
- name: Check formatting
  run: cargo fmt --all -- --check
```
