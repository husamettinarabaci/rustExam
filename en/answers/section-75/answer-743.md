#### âœ… Answer 743: Using `Pin<Box<T>>` safely to prevent moves after initialization

`Pin<Box<T>>` ensures that the value it points to will not be moved in memory after being pinned. This is essential for self-referential types and async tasks.

```rust
use std::pin::Pin;

struct Unmovable {
    data: String,
}

fn main() {
    let x = Unmovable { data: String::from("hello") };
    let mut pinned = Box::pin(x);
    // let y = *pinned; // ERROR: cannot move out of a pinned box
    let data_ref = &pinned.data;
    println!("{}", data_ref);
}
```

Attempting to move the value out of the pinned box will result in a compile-time error.
