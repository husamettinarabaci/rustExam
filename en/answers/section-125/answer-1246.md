Real-time constraints require tasks to complete within strict time limits. Rust helps by providing predictable memory usage, no garbage collection, and low-level control. Frameworks like `rtic` (Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency) support real-time embedded Rust.

```rust
// Example: RTIC framework for real-time tasks (pseudo-code)
#[rtic::app(device = stm32f4xx_hal::pac)]
mod app {
    #[task]
    fn periodic_task(cx: periodic_task::Context) {
        // Real-time safe code here
    }
}
```

Rust's features make it suitable for real-time and scheduled systems.
