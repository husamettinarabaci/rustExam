#### âœ… Answer 1243: Static analysis tools for safety-critical code

Static analysis tools help detect bugs and vulnerabilities before runtime. For Rust, tools like `clippy` and `cargo-audit` are commonly used.

- **clippy**: Lints for code style, correctness, and performance.
- **cargo-audit**: Checks for vulnerable dependencies.

Example usage:
```sh
cargo clippy
cargo audit
```

These tools improve code quality and safety in critical systems.
