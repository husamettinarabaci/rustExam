#### âœ… Answer 1244: Writing certified safe Rust code

Certified safe Rust code is code that meets strict safety and correctness standards, often for regulated industries. Best practices include:

- Avoiding `unsafe` blocks
- Using static analysis and formal verification tools
- Comprehensive code reviews and testing

```rust
fn safe_add(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
    a.checked_add(b).expect("Overflow detected")
}
```

This function avoids overflow and does not use `unsafe`, aligning with certification requirements.
