#### âœ… Answer 1250: Compliance with industry standards (e.g., MISRA, DO-178C)

Industry standards like MISRA and DO-178C require strict safety, reliability, and traceability. Rust's strong type system, memory safety, and lack of undefined behavior help, but tool and process maturity is still evolving.

```rust
// Example: Explicit error handling and no unsafe code
fn safe_div(a: u32, b: u32) -> Option<u32> {
    if b == 0 { None } else { Some(a / b) }
}
```

Following best practices and using static analysis tools can aid compliance in Rust projects.
