#### âœ… Answer 1248: Using Rust in avionics and automotive software

Rust offers memory safety, no data races, and zero-cost abstractions, making it attractive for avionics and automotive software. Challenges include certification hurdles and a less mature embedded ecosystem.

```rust
// Minimal embedded Rust example (pseudo-code)
#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    // Safe, predictable code for microcontroller
    loop {}
}
```

Rust is promising for safety-critical embedded domains, but certification and tooling are evolving.
