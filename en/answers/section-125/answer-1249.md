Testing high-assurance Rust systems involves unit, integration, property-based, and fuzz testing. Rust provides built-in test support and crates like `proptest` and `cargo-fuzz`.

```rust
// Example: Property-based test with proptest
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use proptest::prelude::*;
    proptest! {
        #[test]
        fn add_commutative(a: i32, b: i32) {
            prop_assert_eq!(a + b, b + a);
        }
    }
}
```

These methods help ensure correctness and reliability in critical systems.
