#### âœ… Answer 1247: Secure coding standards and audits

Secure coding standards in Rust include input validation, avoiding `unsafe`, and using strong typing. Code audits involve systematic review of code for vulnerabilities and compliance.

```rust
fn parse_input(input: &str) -> Result<i32, std::num::ParseIntError> {
    input.trim().parse()
}
```

Regular audits and adherence to standards help prevent security issues in critical systems.
