#### âœ… Answer 6: Creating a simple Rust project with Cargo

**Explanation:**

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. You can create and run a new project with these commands:

```sh
cargo new my_project
cd my_project
cargo run
```

The `main.rs` file should look like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Project created!");
}
```
