#### âœ… Answer 490: Deploying Axum applications

To deploy an Axum application to production, follow these steps:

- Build your application in release mode: `cargo build --release`
- Set up environment variables and configuration (e.g., PORT, DATABASE_URL).
- Transfer the compiled binary and required files to the server (e.g., using `scp` or FTP).
- Start the application on the server: `./target/release/app_name`
- Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Caddy) and configure HTTPS for security.
- Run the application in the background (systemd, tmux, supervisor) for reliability.
- Integrate logging and error monitoring tools as needed.
