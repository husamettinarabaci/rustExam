Encapsulating invariants means restricting direct access to struct fields and enforcing rules through methods. In Rust, you can make fields private and provide public methods for controlled access.

```rust
pub struct Account {
    balance: i32, // private
}

impl Account {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Account { balance: 0 }
    }
    pub fn deposit(&mut self, amount: i32) {
        if amount > 0 {
            self.balance += amount;
        }
    }
    pub fn balance(&self) -> i32 {
        self.balance
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut acc = Account::new();
    acc.deposit(100);
    println!("Balance: {}", acc.balance());
}
```
