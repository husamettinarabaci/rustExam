#### âœ… Answer 1477: Integrating reflection with serialization

Reflection and serialization/deserialization are often combined in Rust using derive macros, such as those provided by `serde`. Field names and types are accessed at compile time to generate serialization code automatically.

```rust
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct User { id: u32, name: String }

// Serialization: serde_json::to_string(&user)
// Field information is handled automatically at compile time.
```
