#### âœ… Answer 1478: Performance impacts of compile-time reflection

Compile-time reflection techniques can increase compile times and binary size. Procedural macros and code generation may slow down builds in large projects. The main advantage is reduced code duplication and improved maintainability.

- Advantage: Reduces boilerplate, easier maintenance.
- Disadvantage: Longer compile times, larger binaries.
