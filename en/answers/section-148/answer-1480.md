#### âœ… Answer 1480: Use cases for compile-time reflection in large codebases

In large projects, compile-time reflection is used for automatic trait implementations, API documentation generation, reducing code duplication, and ensuring type safety. Libraries like `serde`, `prost`, and `diesel` use macro-based reflection to improve productivity and safety in large codebases.

- Automatic serialization/deserialization
- Code generation and documentation
- Reducing error risk
