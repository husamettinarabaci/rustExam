Feature flags in Rust allow certain features to be enabled optionally in a project. They are especially useful for managing unstable or experimental features, letting you control which code is compiled.

For example, in a crate's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[features]
experimental = []
```

And in code:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "experimental")]
fn experimental_fn() {
    // Experimental code
}
```

For unstable Rust language features, you enable them on nightly with `#![feature(...)]`. Feature flags let code behave differently in different environments, but care must be taken with unstable features as APIs may change.
