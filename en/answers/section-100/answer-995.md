Trait specialization allows trait methods to be overridden with more specific implementations for certain types. This enables default behavior to be optimized or changed for specific types. Currently, specialization is only available on nightly Rust with `#![feature(specialization)]`.

Example:

```rust
#![feature(specialization)]

trait MyTrait {
    fn foo(&self) { println!("default"); }
}

impl<T> MyTrait for T {}

impl MyTrait for i32 {
    fn foo(&self) { println!("i32 specialized"); }
}
```

On stable Rust, trait specialization is not available; all trait implementations have equal priority. On nightly, trait improvements and specialization allow for more flexible APIs.
