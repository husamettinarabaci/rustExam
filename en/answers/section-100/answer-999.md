#### âœ… Answer 999: Understanding the Rust edition system

The Rust edition system allows for major language changes while maintaining backward compatibility. Each edition can introduce new syntax or features, but old code continues to work.

For example, the 2015, 2018, and 2021 editions introduced changes in syntax and the module system. A project's edition is specified in the `[package]` section of `Cargo.toml`, e.g. `edition = "2021"`.

To change the edition:

```toml
[package]
edition = "2021"
```

The edition system makes it easier for projects to gradually adopt new Rust features.
