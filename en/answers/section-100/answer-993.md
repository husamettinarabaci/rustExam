#### âœ… Answer 993: Experimental async/await features

Async/await in Rust makes concurrent code more readable and manageable. On stable Rust, you can use async functions and `.await` to work with futures. On Nightly Rust, experimental features like async closures and async functions in traits are available for testing.

For example, async closures are only available on nightly:

```rust
#![feature(async_closure)]

fn main() {
    let add_async = async |a: i32, b: i32| -> i32 { a + b };
    // You need an executor to run this (e.g., tokio, async-std)
}
```

Similarly, async functions in traits are being explored on nightly. These features aim to make Rust's async ecosystem more flexible and powerful, but they are not yet stable and their APIs may change.
