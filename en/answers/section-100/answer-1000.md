To prepare a Rust project for future releases, keep your code up to date, use stable Rust, and regularly pay attention to compiler warnings. Tools like `cargo fix`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` help automatically improve your code and catch issues early.

When transitioning versions, follow edition guides and community announcements. The Rust blog, release notes, and forums provide up-to-date information. Keeping your code modular and well-tested makes it easier to adapt to future changes.
