#### âœ… Answer 996: New syntax proposals and macros

New syntax features like "let-else" make error handling and pattern matching more readable in Rust. With "let-else", if a pattern does not match, the else block runs and can exit the function early. This feature is currently only available on nightly Rust.

Example:

```rust
#![feature(let_else)]

fn parse_num(s: &str) -> Option<i32> {
    let Ok(n) = s.parse() else { return None; };
    Some(n)
}
```

This syntax allows for more concise and clear error handling. Similarly, features like inline const and new macro syntax are also being tested on nightly.
