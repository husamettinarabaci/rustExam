The RFC (Request for Comments) process in Rust allows new features or changes to be discussed and evaluated by the community. To add a feature to Rust, an RFC document is prepared and submitted as a PR to the rust-lang/rfcs repository on GitHub.

Community members can review RFCs, join discussions, and make suggestions. The process is transparent and open to everyone. To participate, prepare a document following the RFC template, provide clear reasoning, and be open to feedback.

The RFC process is the main mechanism guiding Rust's evolution and is an important opportunity for those who want to contribute.
