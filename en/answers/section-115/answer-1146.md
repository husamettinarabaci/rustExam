#### âœ… Answer 1146: Deterministic testing with controlled schedulers

Deterministic testing means tests always produce the same result. In concurrent code, controlled schedulers (e.g., `tokio::time::pause`) can control thread order and timing, making tests repeatable and reliable. This prevents random failures and simplifies debugging.
