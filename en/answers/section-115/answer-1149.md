#### âœ… Answer 1149: Using fuzz testing for concurrency bugs

Fuzz testing uses random data and states to find unexpected bugs. For concurrency, tools like `cargo-fuzz` can help. Example usage:

```
cargo install cargo-fuzz
cargo fuzz init
cargo fuzz run fuzz_target_1
```
This can reveal unexpected race conditions and panics.
