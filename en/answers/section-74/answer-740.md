Rust generates a vtable for each trait object type, containing pointers to the methods required by the trait. The vtable is created at compile time and used for dynamic dispatch. The compiler may optimize vtable usage by inlining or devirtualizing calls when possible.

```rust
trait Speak {
    fn speak(&self);
}

struct Cat;
impl Speak for Cat {
    fn speak(&self) { println!("Meow!"); }
}

fn main() {
    let cat = Cat;
    let obj: &dyn Speak = &cat;
    obj.speak();
}
```

To inspect vtable details, you can compile to LLVM IR:

```sh
cargo rustc -- --emit=llvm-ir
```

Or use `cargo asm` to see the generated assembly. The vtable layout includes function pointers for each trait method and type metadata.
