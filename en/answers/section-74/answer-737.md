#### âœ… Answer 737: Implementing custom vtable-based polymorphism manually

You can manually implement vtable-based polymorphism by defining a struct of function pointers and using it to call methods dynamically.

```rust
struct AnimalVTable {
    speak: fn(&()),
}

struct Dog;

fn dog_speak(_: &()) {
    println!("Woof!");
}

fn main() {
    let dog_vtable = AnimalVTable { speak: dog_speak };
    let dog_data = ();
    // Call via vtable
    (dog_vtable.speak)(&dog_data);
}
```

This approach is rarely needed in idiomatic Rust, but it demonstrates how dynamic dispatch can be implemented manually.
