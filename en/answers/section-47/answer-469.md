#### âœ… Answer 469: Compiling and testing a multi-crate workspace

In a workspace with multiple crates, you can build and test all crates with a single command:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

These commands build and test all crates in the workspace. The output lists build and test results for each crate.
