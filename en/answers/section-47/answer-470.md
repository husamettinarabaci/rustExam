To update the version of a crate in a workspace, change the `version` field in the crate's `Cargo.toml`. To publish:

1. Log in to crates.io with `cargo login`.
2. Use `cargo publish -p crate_name` to publish the crate.

Follow semantic versioning and ensure dependencies are up to date before publishing.
