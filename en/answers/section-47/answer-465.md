Large projects can be split into multiple crates, each with a specific responsibility. For example, you might have `core`, `api`, and `cli` crates. The main workspace structure would look like:

```
my_workspace/
  Cargo.toml
  core/
  api/
  cli/
```

Each crate has its own Cargo.toml and can be developed independently.
