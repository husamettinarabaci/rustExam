The actor model is a concurrency paradigm where each "actor" manages its own state and message queue, communicating via message passing. In Rust, actors are often implemented as threads or async tasks that receive messages through channels. This model encourages data sharing via messages instead of shared state.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;

struct Actor;

impl Actor {
    fn handle(&self, msg: String) {
        println!("Actor received: {}", msg);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let actor = Actor;
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for msg in rx {
            actor.handle(msg);
        }
    });
    tx.send("Hello, Actor!".to_string()).unwrap();
}
```
