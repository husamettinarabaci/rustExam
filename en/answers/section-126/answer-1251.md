#### âœ… Answer 1251: Designing plugin systems with dynamic loading

In Rust, a dynamic plugin system involves compiling plugins as shared libraries (e.g., `.so` files) and loading them at runtime using crates like `libloading`. The plugin interface is typically defined using the C ABI for compatibility.

```rust
// Main application side (using libloading)
use libloading::{Library, Symbol};

fn main() {
    let lib = Library::new("./plugin.so").unwrap();
    unsafe {
        let func: Symbol<unsafe extern fn() -> i32> = lib.get(b"plugin_entry").unwrap();
        println!("Plugin result: {}", func());
    }
}
```

Plugin side:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn plugin_entry() -> i32 {
    42
}
```

This approach allows plugins to be compiled independently and loaded at runtime.
