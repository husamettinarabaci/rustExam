#### âœ… Answer 1256: Hot-swapping plugins at runtime

In Rust, hot-swapping is done by dropping the old plugin library, updating the file, and reloading it. The advantage is updating plugins without stopping the app. Avoid using references to the old plugin and manage concurrent access carefully.

Example method:
```rust
use libloading::Library;

fn reload_plugin(path: &str) -> Library {
    // Drop the old Library instance
    Library::new(path).unwrap()
}
```

During hot-swap, the plugin API must not change, and locking mechanisms should be used for thread safety.
