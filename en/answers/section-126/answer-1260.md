#### âœ… Answer 1260: Testing and benchmarking plugin systems

For unit tests, mock the plugin interface. For integration tests, load real plugins and call their functions. Use `std::time::Instant` to measure loading and invocation performance. Improve reliability by testing error scenarios and concurrent loading.

Example benchmark:
```rust
use std::time::Instant;
let start = Instant::now();
// Load plugin and call function
let duration = start.elapsed();
println!("Duration: {:?}", duration);
```

Recommended strategies: thorough error tests, concurrency tests, and automated testing.
