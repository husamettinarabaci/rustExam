#### âœ… Answer 1257: Plugin sandboxing and security considerations

To isolate plugins, use separate processes or WebAssembly (WASM) sandboxes. Sandboxing prevents plugins from harming the main app but may limit performance and communication. For extra security, restrict the plugin API, control file/system access, and verify plugin signatures.

Example sandbox launch:
```rust
use std::process::Command;

let output = Command::new("plugin_bin").output().unwrap();
```

WASM-based sandboxes can also be used. For a secure system, apply least privilege and monitoring mechanisms.
