#### âœ… Answer 1258: Debugging plugin communication and errors

For data transfer, use simple types or serialized formats (JSON/protobuf). For error reporting, plugins can return error codes or custom structs. Detect errors with logging, panic catching (`catch_unwind`), and checking return codes.

Example error reporting:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn plugin_run() -> i32 {
    // 0: success, 1: error
    0
}
```

Common issues include type mismatches, memory management, and panics. Use thorough logging and tests for debugging.
