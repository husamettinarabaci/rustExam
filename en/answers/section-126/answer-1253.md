In Rust plugin systems, dependencies can be managed by sharing a common interface crate between the main app and plugins. Version compatibility can be enforced by checking version numbers at runtime and using semantic versioning. To prevent mismatches, expose a version method in the plugin interface and pin dependency versions in `Cargo.toml`.

Example interface:
```rust
pub trait Plugin {
    fn version(&self) -> &'static str;
}
```

The main app can check plugin compatibility:
```rust
if plugin.version() != APP_SUPPORTED_VERSION {
    panic!("Plugin version mismatch");
}
```

Pinning dependency versions ensures both plugin and app use the same interface version.
