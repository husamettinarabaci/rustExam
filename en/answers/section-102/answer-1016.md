#### âœ… Answer 1016: Implementing actor message queues

In the actor model, a message queue allows the actor to process incoming messages sequentially and provides concurrency control. In Rust, this is typically done with a `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel for each actor.

Example:
```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

struct Actor {
    rx: mpsc::Receiver<String>,
}

impl Actor {
    async fn run(mut self) {
        while let Some(msg) = self.rx.recv().await {
            println!("Received: {}", msg);
        }
    }
}
```
