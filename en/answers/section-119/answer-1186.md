#### âœ… Answer 1186: Distributed actor systems and clustering

In distributed actor systems, actors can run on different machines and communicate over the network. Clustering uses node discovery and message routing techniques. This improves scalability and fault tolerance.

```rust
// Distributed actor system diagram:
//
// Node 1: Actor A
// Node 2: Actor B
//
// Actor A <---network---> Actor B
//
// Clustering enables inter-actor communication.
```
