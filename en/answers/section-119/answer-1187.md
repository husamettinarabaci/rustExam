#### âœ… Answer 1187: Actor-based concurrency in embedded systems

In embedded systems, the actor model allows tasks to run independently and communicate via messages. Real-time requirements are met with prioritization and lightweight actors. This improves resource management and reliability.

```rust
// Embedded actor-based concurrency diagram:
//
// Sensor Actor <---msg---> Controller Actor <---msg---> Actuator Actor
//
// Each actor runs independently and communicates via messages.
```
