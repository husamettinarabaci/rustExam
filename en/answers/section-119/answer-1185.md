#### âœ… Answer 1185: Actor integration with persistent storage

Actors can store their state in persistent storage such as files or databases. Serialization is used for saving, and deserialization for restoring state. This increases system durability.

```rust
// Persistent storage integration diagram:
//
// Actor State --[serialize]--> File/DB
// Actor startup --[deserialize]--> State
//
// Prevents state loss and improves durability.
```
