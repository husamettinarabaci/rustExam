#### âœ… Answer 1181: Designing scalable actor supervision trees

A supervision tree is a hierarchy where actors monitor their children. If a child fails, the parent restarts it. This design improves scalability and fault tolerance.

```rust
// Simple supervision tree diagram (not actual code):
//
// Supervisor
// â”œâ”€â”€ Worker 1
// â”œâ”€â”€ Worker 2
// â””â”€â”€ Worker 3
//
// The supervisor monitors its children and restarts them on failure.
```
