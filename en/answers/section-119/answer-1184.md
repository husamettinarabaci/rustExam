#### âœ… Answer 1184: Message ordering and delivery guarantees

In actor messaging, each actor keeps incoming messages in a queue and processes them sequentially. Queues ensure ordering, and numbering or acknowledgments can provide delivery guarantees. This improves system correctness and reliability.

```rust
// Message ordering and delivery diagram:
//
// Actor A --[msg1]--> Actor B (queue)
//         --[msg2]--> Actor B (queue)
//
// Actor B processes messages in order and acknowledges delivery.
```
