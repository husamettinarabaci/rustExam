#### âœ… Answer 1190: Implementing custom actor frameworks

An actor framework includes actors, mailboxes, a messaging protocol, and error handling as core components. Flexibility, type safety, and fault tolerance are important in the design.

```rust
// Basic actor framework diagram:
//
// ActorSystem
//   â”œâ”€â”€ Actor (mailbox)
//   â”œâ”€â”€ Message
//   â””â”€â”€ Supervisor (error handling)
//
// Each actor receives and processes messages in its own mailbox.
```
