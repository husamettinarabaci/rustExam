#### âœ… Answer 1188: Monitoring and metrics for actor systems

In actor systems, metrics such as message count, processing time, and error rate are collected. Monitoring uses logging, counters, and timers. This helps with system maintenance and error detection.

```rust

//
// Actor --[metrics: msg_count, error_rate, latency]--> Monitoring System
//
// Monitoring tracks system health and performance.
```
