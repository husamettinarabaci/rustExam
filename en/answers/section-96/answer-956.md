Fuzz testing aims to find bugs by testing software with random or unexpected inputs. In Rust, the `cargo-fuzz` tool can be used to write fuzz tests and easily integrate them into CI pipelines.

```bash
# To start a fuzz test
cargo install cargo-fuzz
cargo fuzz run fuzz_target_1
```
In a CI pipeline, these commands can be run automatically to catch unexpected bugs early in the development process.
