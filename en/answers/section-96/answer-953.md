#### âœ… Answer 953: Using model checking tools with Rust

Model checking aims to find bugs by exploring all possible states of a system. In Rust, tools like property-based testing frameworks (e.g., "proptest") or concurrency model checkers like "Loom" are commonly used.

```rust
// Simple concurrency check with Loom
test loom_example {
    use loom::sync::Arc;
    use loom::thread;
    let x = Arc::new(1);
    let y = x.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        assert_eq!(*y, 1);
    }).join().unwrap();
}
```
In this example, Loom tries all possible thread interleavings to find data races.
