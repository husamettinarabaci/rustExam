#### âœ… Answer 1469: DSL profiling and performance monitoring

To monitor DSL execution performance, you can use timing and profiling tools. In Rust, `std::time::Instant` can be used to measure duration.

```rust
use std::time::Instant;

fn main() {
    let start = Instant::now();
    // DSL execution code here
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    println!("Execution time: {:?}", duration);
}
```
