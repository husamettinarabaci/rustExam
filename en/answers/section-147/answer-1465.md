#### âœ… Answer 1465: Handling DSL version migrations

For DSL version migrations, explicit versioning and migration tools can help maintain compatibility. Changes should be documented, and automatic migration tools should be provided for users.

```rust
// Version specification in DSL file:
// version = "2.0"

// Example version check and migration function:
fn migrate_dsl(input: &str, from: &str, to: &str) -> String {
    // Actual migration logic goes here
    format!("Migrated from {} to {}: {}", from, to, input)
}
```
