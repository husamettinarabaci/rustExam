#### âœ… Answer 1468: Security in DSL execution

Executing a DSL can pose risks such as running malicious code, resource exhaustion, or data leaks. Safe execution can be ensured by whitelisting allowed commands and limiting resources.

```rust
// Example of a safe command check:
fn is_command_allowed(cmd: &str) -> bool {
    matches!(cmd, "print" | "add" | "subtract")
}

fn main() {
    let cmd = "delete";
    if is_command_allowed(cmd) {
        println!("Command allowed");
    } else {
        println!("Command blocked");
    }
}
```
