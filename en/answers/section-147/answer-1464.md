#### âœ… Answer 1464: DSLs for reactive programming models

A DSL for reactive programming makes it easy to define data flows and event responses. In Rust, it can be integrated using closures and function chaining.

```rust
// Example DSL:
// on(event) => |data| println!("Event: {}", data)

fn on_event<F: Fn(&str)>(event: &str, handler: F) {
    // Handler is called when the event is triggered (simulated)
    handler(event);
}

fn main() {
    on_event("click", |data| println!("Event: {}", data));
}
```
