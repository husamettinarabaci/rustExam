#### âœ… Answer 275: When should you use `Cell<T>` instead of `RefCell<T>`?

The main difference between `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` is that `Cell<T>` is for simple, `Copy` types and allows get/set operations without borrowing, while `RefCell<T>` is for more complex or reference types and enforces borrowing rules at runtime. `Cell<T>` is not thread-safe and is best for simple value updates like counters or flags. Below is an example of updating a value using `Cell<T>`.

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

struct MyStruct {
    value: Cell<i32>,
}

fn main() {
    let my_struct = MyStruct { value: Cell::new(5) };
    println!("Start: {}", my_struct.value.get());
    my_struct.value.set(10);
    println!("Updated: {}", my_struct.value.get());
}
```

Use `Cell<T>` when you need interior mutability for simple, `Copy` types. For more complex data or references, use `RefCell<T>`.
