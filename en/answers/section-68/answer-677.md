Logging errors is essential for diagnosing issues in production. Use crates like `log` and `env_logger` to log at different levels and report errors.

```rust
use log::{error, warn, info};

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    info!("Application started");
    warn!("This is a warning");
    error!("An error occurred");
    // Simulate reporting to external system
    println!("Reporting error to monitoring service...");
}
```
