#### âœ… Answer 1481: Architecting scalable WASM applications

To architect scalable WASM applications, use a component-based design, centralized and reactive state management, and asynchronous networking. Employ code splitting and lazy loading, optimize data transfer, and keep the WASM module small and fast-loading. Choose efficient data structures and algorithms to maintain performance as the application grows.

```rust
// Key strategies for scalable WASM apps:
// 1. Use component-based architecture.
// 2. Centralize and reactively manage state.
// 3. Handle network requests asynchronously.
// 4. Apply code splitting and lazy loading.
// 5. Minimize data transfer with backend.
// 6. Select efficient data structures and algorithms.
// 7. Keep the WASM module small and fast to load.
```
