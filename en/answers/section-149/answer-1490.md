#### âœ… Answer 1490: Monitoring and logging in WASM applications

For monitoring and logging in WASM apps, set up in-app logging, send logs to the browser console and external services, collect performance metrics (latency, memory, CPU), aggregate errors/events in a central system, and use real-time dashboards for health and performance tracking.

```rust
