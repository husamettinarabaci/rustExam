#### âœ… Answer 1482: State synchronization between WASM and backend

Synchronizing state between WASM and backend involves two-way communication (WebSocket or HTTP polling), serializing state changes, and handling updates from the backend. Use versioning or timestamps to resolve conflicts and implement error handling for latency or disconnects.

```rust
// State sync between WASM and backend:
// 1. Use WebSocket or HTTP polling for two-way communication.
// 2. Serialize and send state changes.
// 3. Process backend updates in WASM.
// 4. Use versioning/timestamps for conflict resolution.
// 5. Add error handling for latency/disconnects.
```
