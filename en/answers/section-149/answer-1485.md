#### âœ… Answer 1485: Using Web Workers with WASM

To use Web Workers with WASM, offload compute-intensive tasks to workers and initialize the WASM module inside the worker. Use message passing for communication between the main thread and workers, and return results to the main thread. Multiple workers can be used for parallel processing.

```rust
// Using Web Workers with WASM:
// 1. Offload heavy computations to a Web Worker.
// 2. Initialize the WASM module inside the worker.
// 3. Use message passing between main thread and worker.
// 4. Send results back to the main thread.
// 5. Use multiple workers for parallelism.
```
