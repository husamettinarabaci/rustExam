#### âœ… Answer 1488: Performance tuning for multi-component WASM applications

For multi-component WASM apps, use code splitting to load modules separately, remove unnecessary dependencies, inline frequently used functions, monitor memory/CPU usage, and optimize rendering and update logic for speed and efficiency.

```rust
// Performance tuning for multi-component WASM apps:
// 1. Use code splitting to load modules separately.
// 2. Remove unnecessary dependencies.
// 3. Inline frequently used functions.
// 4. Monitor memory and CPU usage.
// 5. Optimize rendering and update logic.
