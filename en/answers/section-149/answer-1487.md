Debugging large WASM apps involves using source maps to access original code, leveraging browser developer tools, logging WASM errors and panics, profiling performance, and setting up automated tests and error reporting systems.

```rust
// Debugging large-scale WASM apps:
// 1. Use source maps to access original code.
// 2. Use browser developer tools effectively.
// 3. Log WASM errors and panics to the console.
// 4. Profile performance and identify bottlenecks.
// 5. Set up automated tests and error reporting.
