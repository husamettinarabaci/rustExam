#### âœ… Answer 1483: Load balancing and resource management in WASM frontends

In WASM frontends, queue and limit network requests (rate limiting), use Web Workers for parallel computation, and monitor memory/CPU usage. Clean up unused data and objects, and integrate with server-side load balancing for optimal performance.

```rust
// Load balancing/resource management in WASM frontends:
// 1. Queue and limit network requests (rate limiting).
// 2. Use Web Workers for distributed computation.
// 3. Monitor memory and CPU usage.
// 4. Clean up unused data/objects (garbage collection).
// 5. Integrate with server-side load balancing.
```
