Enums are ideal for modeling the states of an object or system and the transitions between them. Each state is represented as an enum variant.

```rust
enum State {
    Start,
    Running,
    Paused,
    Stopped,
}

fn next_state(state: State) -> State {
    match state {
        State::Start => State::Running,
        State::Running => State::Paused,
        State::Paused => State::Stopped,
        State::Stopped => State::Stopped,
    }
}
```
