Rust's `async`/`await` syntax is syntactic sugar for state machines that implement the `Future` trait. When you write an `async fn` or use an `async` block, the compiler transforms your code into a type that implements `Future`, with its state managed internally. Each `.await` point becomes a yield point in the state machine.

For example, this code:

```rust
async fn foo() -> u32 {
    5
}
```

Is roughly equivalent to:

```rust
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

struct Foo;

impl Future for Foo {
    type Output = u32;
    fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, _cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        Poll::Ready(5)
    }
}
```

The compiler generates a state machine that tracks progress through the async function, resuming execution at each `.await` point. This enables efficient, non-blocking concurrency in Rust.
