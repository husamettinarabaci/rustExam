Scalable async architectures require careful design. Key challenges include task management, resource contention, and error handling. Patterns like task spawning, work stealing, and load balancing help distribute work efficiently.

Best practices:
- Use lightweight tasks and avoid blocking operations.
- Structure code into modules and services.
- Use channels and synchronization primitives for communication.
- Monitor and profile your system to find bottlenecks.

A well-structured async codebase is easier to scale and maintain.
