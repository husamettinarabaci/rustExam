#### âœ… Answer 1210: Performance tuning for async network applications

Performance in async network applications can be improved with task parallelism, buffering, and proper task scheduling. In Rust, features like `tokio::spawn`, `buffer`, and `select!` can help boost throughput.

```rust
use tokio::stream::{self, StreamExt};
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let s = stream::iter(1..=5).map(|i| async move {
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
        i * 2
    });
    let results: Vec<_> = s.buffer_unordered(3).collect().await;
    println!("Results: {:?}", results);
}
```

This example uses `buffer_unordered` to run multiple async tasks concurrently, increasing throughput.
