Partial evaluation resolves constant parts of expressions at compile time, leaving variable parts for runtime. In Rust, macros or `const fn` can be used for this purpose.

```rust
macro_rules! partial_eval {
    ($a:expr, $b:expr) => {
        $a + $b // Constant parts are resolved at compile time
    };
}

fn main() {
    let x = 2;
    let y = 3;
    let result = partial_eval!(x, y);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```
This technique improves performance and efficiency.
