#### âœ… Answer 1370: Profiling DSL execution performance

To profile DSL execution performance, measure execution time using `std::time::Instant` in Rust.

```rust
use std::time::Instant;

fn run_dsl() {
    // DSL expression execution here
    let mut sum = 0;
    for i in 0..10000 {
        sum += i;
    }
    sum
}

fn main() {
    let start = Instant::now();
    let result = run_dsl();
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    println!("Result: {}, Duration: {:?}", result, duration);
}
```
This method helps identify bottlenecks and improve performance.
