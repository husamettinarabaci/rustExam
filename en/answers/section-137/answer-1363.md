Lazy evaluation can be implemented in Rust using closures or a `Lazy` structure. This ensures that expressions are only evaluated when needed, saving memory and computation.

```rust
fn lazy_eval<F: FnOnce() -> T, T>(f: F) -> T {
    // The expression is only evaluated here
    f()
}

fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let result = lazy_eval(|| x * 2);
    println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```
This approach provides performance and memory benefits.
