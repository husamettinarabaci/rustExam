#### âœ… Answer 1425: Optimizing procedural macro performance

Procedural macros generate code at compile time and can increase build times if complex. To optimize, keep macro code simple, avoid unnecessary parsing or analysis, and use caching where possible. Use `cargo build -Z timings` to measure macro performance.

```rust
// Avoid unnecessary parsing and analysis in procedural macros
```

Modular and efficient macro code helps reduce compile times.
