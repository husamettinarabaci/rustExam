#### âœ… Answer 1426: Managing dependencies for fast builds

Dependencies directly affect build times. Removing unnecessary dependencies and using small, independent crates can speed up builds. Use `cargo tree` to analyze dependencies.

```bash
cargo tree
```

Reducing dependencies in frequently changing code helps keep builds fast.
