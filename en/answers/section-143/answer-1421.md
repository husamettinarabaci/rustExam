#### âœ… Answer 1421: Minimizing compile times with incremental builds

Incremental compilation in Rust allows only changed files or modules to be recompiled, rather than rebuilding the entire project. This feature is enabled by default and significantly speeds up development cycles, especially in large projects. It can be controlled with the `CARGO_INCREMENTAL` environment variable. Note that for full optimizations (e.g., with `--release`), incremental compilation may be disabled.

```rust
// Incremental compilation is usually enabled by default, but can be set manually:
// $ CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1 cargo build
```

Incremental builds greatly reduce compile times after small code changes.
