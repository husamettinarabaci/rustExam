#### âœ… Answer 1423: Reducing code bloat from generics

Using generics in Rust causes the compiler to generate code for each concrete type, which can increase compile times and binary size. To reduce code bloat, consider using trait objects (`dyn Trait`), minimizing the use of generics, and abstracting common code.

```rust
// Using trait objects can reduce generic code bloat:
fn process(items: &[Box<dyn Display>]) { /* ... */ }
```

Avoiding unnecessary generic parameters helps keep compile times and binary size down.
