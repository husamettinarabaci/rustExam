#### âœ… Answer 1430: Balancing code reuse and compile speed

Reducing code duplication through modularity and generics is good, but excessive modularity and generics can slow down builds. Centralizing common code in a single crate and minimizing unnecessary generics helps balance reuse and compile speed.

```rust
// Collect common helper functions in a single module
```

Careful planning of modularity helps reduce duplication while maintaining fast builds.
