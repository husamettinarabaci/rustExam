Continuous integration (CI) in plugin ecosystems ensures tests are run automatically on every change. Tools like GitHub Actions can automate test execution.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml
name: Plugin CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test
```
This configuration runs tests on every code change and sends notifications if tests fail.
