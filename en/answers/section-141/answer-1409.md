To automate plugin deployment, use CI/CD tools to automate packaging, testing, and publishing. For example, a GitHub Actions workflow can be used for deployment.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
name: Plugin Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*.*.*'
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
      - name: Build
        run: cargo build --release
      - name: Test
        run: cargo test
      - name: Package
        run: cargo package
      - name: Publish
        run: cargo publish --token ${{ secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}
```
