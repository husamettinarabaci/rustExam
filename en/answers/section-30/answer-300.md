#### âœ… Answer 300: Using idiomatic module structure in real-world crates

In large, real-world Rust projects, modules are organized logically to improve readability and maintainability. Each main module is defined in its own file or folder. Use `mod` to declare modules, `use` to import them, and `pub` to expose items. Here is an example directory and code structure:

```
my_crate/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib.rs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ network/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ client.rs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils.rs
```

`lib.rs`:
```rust
pub mod network;
pub mod utils;
```

`network/mod.rs`:
```rust
pub mod client;

pub fn connect() {
    // ...
}
```

`network/client.rs`:
```rust
pub fn send_request() {
    // ...
}
```

`utils.rs`:
```rust
pub fn helper() {
    // ...
}
```

This structure allows logical separation and easy reuse of modules. Functions and modules marked with `pub` are accessible from outside the crate.
