#### âœ… Answer 831: Designing stable public APIs across crate boundaries

To design stable APIs across crate boundaries:

- Document APIs clearly and avoid unnecessary changes.
- Deprecate old functions instead of removing them to maintain backward compatibility.
- Use semantic versioning (semver) and track changes with a CHANGELOG.
- Keep the API surface minimal and consistent.
