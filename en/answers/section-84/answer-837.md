To manage multiple crates in a workspace, define a `[workspace]` section in the top-level Cargo.toml. Shared dependencies can be managed at the workspace level. Advantages:

- Easier code sharing and version compatibility.
- Centralized build and test processes.
- Caveat: Dependency versions must be kept compatible to avoid build issues.
