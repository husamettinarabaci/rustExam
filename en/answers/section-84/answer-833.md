#### âœ… Answer 833: Using re-exports to simplify crate interfaces

Re-exporting with `pub use` makes items from other modules accessible from the parent module or crate interface. This allows users to access necessary items without knowing the internal module structure. Advantages:

- Simplifies the API and makes it easier to use.
- Internal module changes do not affect the public interface.
- Caveat: Excessive re-exporting can unnecessarily increase the API surface.
