#### âœ… Answer 834: Semantic versioning and compatibility

Semantic versioning (semver) is a standard for meaningful version numbers: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Increase MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for backward-compatible additions, and PATCH for bug fixes. To ensure backward compatibility, deprecate old APIs before removal and give users time to migrate.
