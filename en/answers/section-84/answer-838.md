#### âœ… Answer 838: Version conflicts and dependency resolution

Version conflicts occur when different dependencies require different versions of the same crate. Cargo tries to use a single version if possible; otherwise, it builds multiple versions. To resolve conflicts:

- Keep dependencies up to date and compatible.
- Use `cargo update` and `cargo tree` to analyze dependencies.
- Specify versions directly or simplify dependencies if needed.
