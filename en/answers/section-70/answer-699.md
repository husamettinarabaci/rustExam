#### âœ… Answer 699: Monitoring and tracing distributed systems

Distributed Rust systems can be monitored and traced using crates like `tracing`, `opentelemetry`, and exporters for Prometheus or Jaeger.

Example:
```rust
use tracing::{info, instrument};

#[instrument]
fn process() {
    info!("Processing started");
}

fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt::init();
    process();
}
```
This enables structured logging and tracing for observability.
