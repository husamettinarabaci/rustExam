#### âœ… Answer 1176: Preventing the ABA problem

The ABA problem occurs when a value changes from A to B and back to A, causing atomic operations to succeed incorrectly. This can lead to data inconsistency.

Rust solutions:
- Use a tagged pointer (pointer + counter)
- Store both address and counter in an `AtomicU64`
- Use epoch-based memory management (e.g., via crossbeam)

These techniques help reduce or prevent the ABA problem.
