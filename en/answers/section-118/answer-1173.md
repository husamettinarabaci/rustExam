#### âœ… Answer 1173: Designing lock-free queues and stacks

Lock-free queues and stacks in Rust are typically built using atomic pointers and CAS (compare-and-swap) operations. Classic algorithms include the Michael-Scott queue and Treiber stack.

Challenges:
- ABA problem
- Memory management
- Correct ordering guarantees

For a simple stack:
```rust
// Treiber stack uses atomic pointers, often via crossbeam or std::sync::atomic.
```
In practice, crates like crossbeam are recommended for real implementations.
