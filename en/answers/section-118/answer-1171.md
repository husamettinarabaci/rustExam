#### âœ… Answer 1171: Principles of lock-free programming

Lock-free programming enables concurrent access to data structures without using locks. Key principles:

- Use atomic operations (e.g., `AtomicUsize`).
- Careful design is required to avoid data races.
- Be aware of issues like the ABA problem and memory ordering.

Example:
```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};

let counter = AtomicUsize::new(0);
counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::SeqCst);
```
Here, the `counter` is incremented atomically without a lock.
