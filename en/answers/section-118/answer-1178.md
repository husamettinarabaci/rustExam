#### âœ… Answer 1178: Debugging lock-free code

Common bugs in lock-free data structures:
- Data races
- ABA problem
- Incorrect memory ordering

Debugging methods:
- Use the `loom` crate for deterministic testing
- Use `miri` to detect memory errors
- Test modules in crates like crossbeam

These tools help ensure the safety of lock-free code.
