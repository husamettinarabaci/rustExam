#### âœ… Answer 349: Inspecting code with cargo expand or cargo asm

The `cargo expand` tool lets you see macro expansions and the actual code generated by the compiler, which is useful for understanding derive macros or procedural macros. The `cargo asm` tool shows the compiled assembly output for a specific function, helping with performance analysis and optimization.

Example usage:

```sh
cargo expand
cargo asm my_crate::main
```

These commands display, respectively, the expanded Rust code and the compiled assembly code in your terminal.
