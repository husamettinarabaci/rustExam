#### âœ… Answer 346: Testing failure conditions with `#[should_panic]`

The `#[should_panic]` attribute tells the test runner that the test should panic. If the function does not panic, the test fails. This is useful for testing error conditions and expected panics.

```rust
fn will_panic() {
    panic!("This is a panic!");
}

#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn test_panic() {
    will_panic();
}
```
