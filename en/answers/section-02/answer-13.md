#### âœ… Answer 13: Defining an array and accessing its elements

**Explanation:**

Arrays in Rust have a fixed length and all elements must be of the same type. You can access elements using indexing.

```rust
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    println!("First: {}", arr[0]);
    println!("Second: {}", arr[1]);
    println!("Third: {}", arr[2]);
    println!("Fourth: {}", arr[3]);
    println!("Fifth: {}", arr[4]);
}
```
