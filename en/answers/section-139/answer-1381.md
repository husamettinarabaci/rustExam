#### âœ… Answer 1381: Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open standard for collecting traces, metrics, and logs in distributed systems. In Rust microservices, OpenTelemetry enables centralized tracking of service calls and performance. Integration involves using the `opentelemetry` and related crates, initializing a tracer, and creating spans in your application. Collected data can be exported to systems like Jaeger, Zipkin, or Prometheus.

Benefits: Easily identify inter-service latency, errors, and performance bottlenecks.
