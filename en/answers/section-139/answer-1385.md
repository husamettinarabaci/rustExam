Alerting systems are essential for quickly detecting anomalies and errors in microservices. In Rust services, tools like Prometheus Alertmanager, Grafana, or Opsgenie can be used to set up metric- and log-based alerts. Automated incident response can use webhooks, automation scripts, or manual notifications. These systems reduce downtime and enable rapid intervention.
