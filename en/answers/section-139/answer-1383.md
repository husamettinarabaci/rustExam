Log collection is critical for debugging and event tracking in microservices. In Rust services, logs can be collected using crates like `log` or `tracing`. Logs are sent to a centralized system (e.g., ELK, Loki) for analysis. This enables centralized monitoring of errors, warnings, and system behavior.
