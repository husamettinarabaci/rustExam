Metrics collection is essential for monitoring the health and performance of microservices. In Rust services, metrics can be collected using crates like `metrics`, `opentelemetry`, or `prometheus`. Collected metrics can be stored in Prometheus and visualized with tools like Grafana. This helps identify bottlenecks and anomalies in the system.
