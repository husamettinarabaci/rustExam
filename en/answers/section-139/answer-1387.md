#### âœ… Answer 1387: Using service meshes for observability

A service mesh is an infrastructure layer that manages communication between microservices and provides features like observability, security, and traffic management. In Rust-based systems, service meshes like Istio or Linkerd can automate telemetry, tracing, and logging. Service meshes enable centralized monitoring of requests, error rates, and latency.
