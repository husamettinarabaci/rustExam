#### âœ… Answer 850: Writing reliable tests for complex systems

For complex systems, reliable tests should be isolated, repeatable, and easy to maintain. Use modular test structures, fixtures, and mock dependencies to achieve this.

```rust
struct App {
    value: i32,
}

impl App {
    fn new() -> Self { App { value: 0 } }
    fn increment(&mut self) { self.value += 1; }
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn setup() -> App {
        App::new()
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_increment() {
        let mut app = setup();
        app.increment();
        assert_eq!(app.value, 1);
    }
}
```

This example uses a fixture for isolated and repeatable tests.
