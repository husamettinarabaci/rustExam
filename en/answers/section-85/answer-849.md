Running automated tests with continuous integration (CI) in Rust projects ensures bugs are caught early and code quality is maintained. Tools like GitHub Actions make CI setup easy.

Example GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Rust CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Rust
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
      - name: Run tests
        run: cargo test --all
```

Automation quickly detects errors and increases code reliability.
