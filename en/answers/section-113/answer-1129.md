Testing actor systems involves verifying that messages are processed correctly. In Rust, you can use test functions to check actor messaging.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    #[test]
    fn test_actor_message() {
        let mut actor = CounterActor { count: 0 };
        actor.handle_increment();
        assert_eq!(actor.count, 1);
    }
}
```
This test checks that the actor processes a message and updates its state.
