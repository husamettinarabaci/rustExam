The most popular actor frameworks in Rust are `Actix`, `riker`, and `xactor`. Actix is high-performance, mature, and has a large community. Riker is known for its classic actor model and flexibility. Xactor is designed for modern async/await Rust projects. Each is suitable for different scales and needs.

```rust
// Example: Simple actor with Actix
use actix::prelude::*;

struct MyActor;
impl Actor for MyActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;
}
```
