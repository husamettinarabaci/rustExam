#### âœ… Answer 1399: Continuous architecture and evolution

Continuous architectural evolution means improving software architecture in small, ongoing steps. In Rust projects, this can be achieved through regular code reviews, automated tests, and refactoring.

Example: Splitting code into modules, securing legacy code with tests, and adding new features in small increments.

This approach prevents technical debt accumulation and increases long-term project sustainability.
