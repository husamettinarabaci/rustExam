#### âœ… Answer 1396: Modularizing large Rust projects

Modularization means splitting code into independent, reusable parts. In large Rust projects, modules can be organized as follows:

```
src/
  main.rs
  user/
    mod.rs
    service.rs
    model.rs
  order/
    mod.rs
    service.rs
    model.rs
```

This structure improves code readability and maintainability, and allows teams to work in parallel.
