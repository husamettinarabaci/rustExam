#### âœ… Answer 1397: Automating code migrations

Code migration is moving code to a new structure or version. In Rust projects, you can use these tools for automation:

- `cargo fix` for automatic fixes
- `rustfmt` for code formatting
- Scripts or macros for batch changes

Example command:
```
cargo fix --edition
```
These tools reduce manual errors and speed up migrations in large codebases.
