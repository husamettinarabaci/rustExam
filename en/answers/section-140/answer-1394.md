#### âœ… Answer 1394: Managing technical debt effectively

Technical debt is the accumulated need for improvement in code due to quick fixes or rapid development. To manage technical debt in Rust projects:

- Apply code reviews and automated tests.
- Improve code readability and modularity.
- Reduce unnecessary code duplication.

Example: Move repeated logic into a shared function to lower maintenance costs and reduce technical debt.
