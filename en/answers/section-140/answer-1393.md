#### âœ… Answer 1393: Applying domain-driven design principles

Domain-driven design (DDD) models complex business logic using concepts like domain entities and value objects. Example in Rust:

```rust
// Value Object
struct Email(String);

// Domain Entity
struct User {
    id: u32,
    email: Email,
}
```

DDD clarifies business logic and makes code easier to maintain and test. Rust's type system supports implementing DDD concepts safely and clearly.
