#### âœ… Answer 1392: Gradual migration to microservices

The main steps for migrating from a monolithic application to microservices are:

- Define service boundaries and create independent modules.
- Split each module into a separate service.
- Define inter-service communication (e.g., HTTP, gRPC).
- Create APIs to share common data and business logic.

Example structure:
```rust
// Monolithic structure
mod user;
mod order;

fn main() {
    // ...
}

// Microservices structure
// user_service/src/main.rs
// order_service/src/main.rs
```
Benefits: Easier scalability, independent deployment, fault isolation.
Challenges: Complexity of inter-service communication, distributed tracing and debugging.
