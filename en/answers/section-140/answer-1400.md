#### âœ… Answer 1400: Planning for future scalability and extensibility

Scalability means maintaining performance under increased load. Extensibility is the ease of adding new features. In Rust projects, to achieve these goals:

- Use modular and loosely coupled design.
- Create flexible APIs with traits and generics.
- Reduce dependencies to simplify testing and maintenance.

Example: Keep each feature in a separate module and define shared behavior with traits.

These approaches help keep the project manageable and maintainable as it grows.
