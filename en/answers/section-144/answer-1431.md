#### âœ… Answer 1431: Exploring WASM toolchains and runtimes

The main toolchains for WASM development in Rust are `wasm-pack`, `cargo-web`, `trunk`, and `wasm-bindgen`. `wasm-pack` is used for packaging and publishing, `trunk` provides auto-build and hot-reload for frontend projects, and `wasm-bindgen` bridges Rust and JavaScript. Runtimes include browsers, Node.js, and WASI. Each tool is suited for different scenarios (e.g., web, server, CLI).

```rust
// Example: Build with wasm-pack
// $ wasm-pack build --target web
```
