Tools like `wasm-bench`, `criterion`, browser profilers, and Node.js benchmarking tools are used to measure WASM performance. Key metrics include execution time, memory usage, and startup time. Benchmarking involves running the module in different scenarios and comparing results.

```rust
// Using criterion in Rust
// [dependencies]
// criterion = "*"
```
