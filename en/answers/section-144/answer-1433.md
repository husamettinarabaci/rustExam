#### âœ… Answer 1433: Using WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)

WASI allows WebAssembly modules to access system resources like the file system and network. In Rust, it is used with runtimes such as `wasmtime` or `wasmer`. For example, a WASI program can read input from the terminal or write to a file. WASI is suitable for server-side applications and CLI tools.

```rust
// Example: Print with WASI
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, WASI!");
}
```
