#### âœ… Answer 210: Understanding macro limitations in Rust

Rust macros have limitations: hygiene can make some patterns hard, recursion is limited, and error messages can be cryptic. Macros can't do everything functions can, and debugging can be difficult.

- Hygiene prevents some variable manipulations.
- Recursion depth is limited.
- Error messages may be unclear.
- Macros can't access runtime values.
