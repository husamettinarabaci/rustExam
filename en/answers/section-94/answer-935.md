#### âœ… Answer 935: Asynchronous message queues

Asynchronous message queues allow services to communicate without waiting for each other, improving scalability and reliability in distributed systems. They decouple producers and consumers, enabling buffering, retries, and flexible processing.

In Rust, you can use crates like `lapin` (for RabbitMQ) or `rdkafka` (for Kafka). Here is a simplified example using `lapin` pseudocode:

```rust
// Sending a message (producer)
async fn send_message(channel: &lapin::Channel) {
    channel.basic_publish(
        "my_queue",
        "",
        lapin::options::BasicPublishOptions::default(),
        b"Hello, world!",
        lapin::BasicProperties::default(),
    ).await.unwrap();
}

// Receiving a message (consumer)
async fn receive_message(channel: &lapin::Channel) {
    let mut consumer = channel.basic_consume(
        "my_queue",
        "my_consumer",
        lapin::options::BasicConsumeOptions::default(),
        lapin::BasicProperties::default(),
    ).await.unwrap();
    while let Some(delivery) = consumer.next().await {
        let data = delivery.unwrap().data;
        println!("Received: {:?}", data);
    }
}
```

Message queues in Rust provide strong type safety and async support, but integrating with external brokers and handling errors can be complex. They are essential for building robust, scalable microservices.
