Distributed consensus is the process by which a group of computers (nodes) agree on a single data value or state, even in the presence of failures. It is crucial for ensuring consistency in distributed systems, such as databases or microservices.

Raft and Paxos are popular consensus algorithms. Raft, for example, uses leader election and log replication to maintain consistency. Below is a simplified Rust example of a Raft leader election step:

```rust
enum State {
    Follower,
    Candidate,
    Leader,
}

struct Node {
    id: u32,
    state: State,
    term: u32,
    voted_for: Option<u32>,
}

impl Node {
    fn start_election(&mut self) {
        self.state = State::Candidate;
        self.term += 1;
        self.voted_for = Some(self.id);
        // In a real system, send RequestVote RPCs to other nodes
        println!("Node {} started election for term {}", self.id, self.term);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut node = Node { id: 1, state: State::Follower, term: 0, voted_for: None };
    node.start_election();
}
```

Implementing consensus in real systems is challenging due to network partitions, node failures, and the need for strong consistency guarantees. Production-grade implementations require handling timeouts, retries, persistent storage, and more.
