#### âœ… Answer 931: Building microservices with Rust

Rust is well-suited for microservices due to its performance, memory safety, and low resource usage. A typical Rust microservice uses frameworks like Actix or Axum, exposes REST or gRPC APIs, and is containerized for deployment. Best practices include clear API boundaries, robust error handling, and using async runtimes for scalability. Example: use Axum to build a RESTful service and Docker for deployment.
