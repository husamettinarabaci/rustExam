#### âœ… Answer 932: Using gRPC and Protocol Buffers

Rust supports gRPC and Protocol Buffers via crates like `tonic` and `prost`. gRPC enables efficient, strongly-typed service communication. Define your service in a `.proto` file, then use `prost-build` or `tonic-build` to generate Rust code. Example: use `tonic` to implement a gRPC server and client. This approach is ideal for scalable, language-agnostic distributed systems.
