#### âœ… Answer 940: Cloud-native Rust application design

Cloud-native applications are designed for scalability, resilience, and easy deployment in cloud environments. They embrace statelessness, configuration via environment variables, health checks, and graceful shutdown.

Example: Reading configuration from environment variables and handling graceful shutdown in Rust:

```rust
use std::env;
use tokio::signal;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Read configuration from environment
    let port = env::var("SERVICE_PORT").unwrap_or_else(|_| "8080".to_string());
    println!("Starting service on port {}", port);

    // Wait for shutdown signal
    signal::ctrl_c().await.expect("failed to listen for event");
    println!("Shutting down gracefully");
}
```

Best practices: keep services stateless, externalize configuration, implement health endpoints, and ensure graceful shutdown. These patterns make Rust microservices robust and cloud-ready.
