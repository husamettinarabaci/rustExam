#### âœ… Answer 1234: Handling asynchronous communication between services

Asynchronous communication decouples services and improves scalability. Common patterns include message queues (RabbitMQ), event buses, and pub/sub systems (Kafka).

In Rust:
- Use `lapin` for RabbitMQ or `rdkafka` for Kafka.
- Send and receive messages asynchronously using async/await.

Example (lapin):
```rust
use lapin::{options::*, types::FieldTable, Connection, ConnectionProperties};

let conn = Connection::connect("amqp://localhost:5672/", ConnectionProperties::default()).await?;
let channel = conn.create_channel().await?;
channel.basic_publish("", "queue", BasicPublishOptions::default(), b"msg", BasicProperties::default()).await?;
```
This enables reliable, decoupled communication between Rust microservices.
