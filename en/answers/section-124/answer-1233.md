#### âœ… Answer 1233: Implementing API gateways in Rust

An API gateway acts as a single entry point for clients, handling routing, authentication, and more.

- Use frameworks like `axum`, `warp`, or `actix-web` for HTTP handling.
- Implement middleware for authentication and rate limiting.
- Route requests to backend services based on path or headers.

Example (axum):
```rust
use axum::{Router, routing::get};

let app = Router::new()
    .route("/users", get(forward_to_user_service))
    .route("/orders", get(forward_to_order_service));
```
This structure allows you to centralize cross-cutting concerns and manage microservice traffic efficiently.
