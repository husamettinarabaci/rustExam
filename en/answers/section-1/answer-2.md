#### âœ… Answer 2: Adding a comment in Rust

**Explanation:**

Rust uses `//` for single-line comments. Placing a comment above the `main` function helps explain the purpose of the code. This is a best practice for code readability.

```rust
// This program prints a message to demonstrate comments in Rust.
fn main() {
    println!("This is a comment example.");
}
```
