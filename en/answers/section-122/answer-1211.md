Consensus in distributed systems is the process by which multiple nodes agree on a single data value or decision, even in the presence of failures. It is essential for ensuring data consistency, leader election, and ordering of operations. Classic consensus algorithms include Paxos, Raft, and Zab, each designed to handle failures and maintain system reliability.
