#### âœ… Answer 1216: Handling network partitions gracefully

A network partition occurs when a network splits into two or more sub-networks. In distributed systems, strategies like quorum, retries, and post-partition reconciliation are used to maintain consistency and availability. In Rust, you can build partition-tolerant systems using quorum-based decision logic and robust error handling.
