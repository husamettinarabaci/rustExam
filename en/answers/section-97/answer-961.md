#### âœ… Answer 961: Exploring Rustâ€™s parser and lexer

In the Rust compiler, the lexer breaks source code into meaningful tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals. The parser then takes these tokens and builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) according to Rustâ€™s grammar.

For example, the statement `let x = 5 + 3;` is tokenized as:
- `let` (keyword)
- `x` (identifier)
- `=` (assignment operator)
- `5` (number)
- `+` (operator)
- `3` (number)
- `;` (semicolon)

The parser uses these tokens to construct an AST representing a variable assignment expression.
