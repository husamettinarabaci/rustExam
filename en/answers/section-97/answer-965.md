To contribute to the Rust compiler, first clone the source code, set up your development environment, and prepare the necessary tools (e.g., `x.py`). The process usually involves picking an issue, developing a solution, and submitting a pull request. Challenges include the complex codebase, long build times, and extensive test coverage. Reading documentation and communicating with the community are important.
