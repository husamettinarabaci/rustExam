In Rust, macro expansion is the process of transforming macro invocations in source code into actual code blocks. The compiler finds macro calls and expands them into the corresponding code. For example, `println!("Hello");` is expanded at compile time into the appropriate function call. Macro expansion occurs before or during parsing and is included in the final AST.
