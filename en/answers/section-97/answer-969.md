In the Rust compiler, a panic is when the compiler stops due to an unexpected error. Errors are usually reported to the user. To debug panics and errors, use compiler logs, error messages, and tools like `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`. For example, by examining a panic message and stack trace, you can locate and fix the faulty line of code.
