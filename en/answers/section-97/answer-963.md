To add a new language feature to Rust, the typical steps are: (1) Write an RFC describing the feature, (2) discuss it with the community and core team, (3) implement the syntax and semantics in the compiler, (4) add tests and documentation.

For example, suppose we want to add a new keyword `defer`. Syntax: `defer { ... }`. This would specify code to run at the end of a block. Integrating it requires changes to the lexer, parser, and code generation stages of the compiler.
