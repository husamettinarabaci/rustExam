#### âœ… Answer 1137: Preventing priority inversion and starvation

Priority inversion occurs when a low-priority thread blocks a high-priority one. Starvation is when a thread never gets access to resources. In Rust, fair locks or priority protocols can help prevent these issues.

```rust
// Rust's std::sync::Mutex is fair, but for custom protocols, additional algorithms are needed.
// For example, priority inheritance can reduce priority inversion.
```
Choose appropriate lock strategies and algorithms to avoid these problems.
