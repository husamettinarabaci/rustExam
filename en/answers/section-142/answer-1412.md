A language server for a DSL integrates with editors via the LSP protocol. Basic architecture:
- Parser for syntax and semantic analysis
- Features: auto-completion, error highlighting, symbol search
- Server application communicating via LSP

In Rust, crates like `tower-lsp` can be used to implement an LSP server.
