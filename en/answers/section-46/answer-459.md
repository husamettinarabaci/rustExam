#### âœ… Answer 459: Inspecting code with `cargo expand` or `cargo asm`

`cargo expand` shows macro expansions, while `cargo asm` displays the compiled code's assembly output. These tools help you understand how the compiler processes your code.

In the terminal:

```
cargo expand   # Shows macro expansions
cargo asm      # Shows assembly output
```

These tools are useful for performance analysis and macro inspection.
