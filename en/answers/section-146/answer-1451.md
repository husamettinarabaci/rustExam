#### âœ… Answer 1451: Designing plugin sandbox environments

Sandbox environments in plugin systems isolate plugins from the host application, improving security and preventing resource abuse. In Rust, you can design a sandbox using OS-level process isolation, resource limits (CPU, memory), and file system access controls.

Below is a simple example of running a plugin in a separate process as a sandbox boundary:

```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn run_plugin_sandboxed(plugin_path: &str) {
    let output = Command::new(plugin_path)
        .arg("--sandboxed")
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to run plugin in sandbox");
    println!("Plugin output: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout));
}
```
This example launches the plugin in a separate process, isolating it from the main application. For advanced isolation, you can use seccomp, cgroups, or container technologies on Linux.
