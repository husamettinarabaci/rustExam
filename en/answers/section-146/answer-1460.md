#### âœ… Answer 1460: Optimizing plugin call performance

Performance in plugin calls is critical for overall application efficiency. In Rust, you can use profiling, caching, and async call techniques to improve performance.

Here is a simple example of measuring and optimizing call duration:

```rust
use std::time::Instant;

fn plugin_call() { /* ... */ }
let start = Instant::now();
plugin_call();
let duration = start.elapsed();
println!("Call took: {:?}", duration);
```
This code measures the duration of a plugin call for performance analysis.
