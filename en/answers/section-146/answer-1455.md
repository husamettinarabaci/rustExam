#### âœ… Answer 1455: Plugin dependency graphs and resolution

A plugin dependency graph models relationships and load order between plugins. In Rust, dependencies can be represented as a graph, and issues like cycles or version conflicts can be detected.

Here is a basic skeleton for dependency resolution using topological sorting:

```rust
fn resolve_dependencies(graph: &[(usize, usize)]) -> Vec<usize> {
    // graph: (dependent, dependency)
    // A simple topological sort algorithm can be applied
    vec![] // For a full solution, consider using crates like petgraph
}
```
This function provides a starting point for resolving a dependency graph.
