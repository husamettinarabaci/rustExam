#### âœ… Answer 1452: Version negotiation protocols for plugins

Version negotiation protocols ensure compatibility between the host application and plugins. In Rust, you can exchange version numbers and prevent loading if there is a mismatch.

Here is a simple version check protocol example:

```rust
const HOST_VERSION: &str = "1.0.0";
fn check_plugin_version(plugin_version: &str) -> bool {
    plugin_version == HOST_VERSION
}
```
This function compares the plugin's version to the host's version and returns whether they are compatible.
