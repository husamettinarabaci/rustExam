Cross-language plugin interoperability allows plugins written in different languages to integrate with a Rust host. Rust supports safe integration with C/C++ libraries using FFI (Foreign Function Interface).

Below is a simple example of calling a C function from Rust using FFI:

```rust
extern "C" {
    fn c_plugin_function(x: i32) -> i32;
}

fn call_c_plugin(x: i32) -> i32 {
    unsafe { c_plugin_function(x) }
}
```
Here, Rust code safely calls a C function. When using FFI, memory safety and type compatibility are important.
