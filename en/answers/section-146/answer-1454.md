#### âœ… Answer 1454: Implementing plugin hot reload

Hot reload allows a plugin to be reloaded while the application is running, which is useful for rapid development and updates. In Rust, plugins can be loaded and swapped at runtime using dynamic libraries (`.so`, `.dll`).

Here is an example of loading a dynamic library for hot reload in Rust:

```rust
use libloading::{Library, Symbol};

fn load_plugin(path: &str) {
    let lib = Library::new(path).expect("Failed to load plugin");
    unsafe {
        let func: Symbol<unsafe extern fn()> = lib.get(b"plugin_entry").unwrap();
        func();
    }
}
```
This code loads a plugin dynamically and calls its entry function. For hot reload, the old library can be dropped and a new one loaded.
