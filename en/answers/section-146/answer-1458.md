Plugin state corruption is a type of bug that causes a plugin to behave unexpectedly. In Rust, you can use logging and debugging techniques to detect such issues.

Here is a simple mechanism for detecting state corruption:

```rust
struct PluginState { valid: bool }
fn check_state(state: &PluginState) {
    if !state.valid {
        eprintln!("State corruption detected!");
    }
}
```
This code checks the plugin state and prints an error if corruption is detected.
