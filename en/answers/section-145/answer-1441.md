#### âœ… Answer 1441: Implementing authentication and authorization

Rust microservices commonly use JWT, OAuth2, or OpenID Connect for authentication. The flow involves obtaining a token after verifying user identity, and validating this token on each request. For security, ensure token secrecy, use HTTPS, and enforce proper authorization checks.

```rust
// Example crate for JWT validation: jsonwebtoken
```
