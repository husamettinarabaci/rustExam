#### âœ… Answer 93: Method taking `&self` and `&mut self`

In Rust, methods can take `&self` for immutable access or `&mut self` for mutable access. Here, we define a `Counter` struct with a `value` method (immutable) and an `increment` method (mutable).

```rust
struct Counter {
    count: i32,
}

impl Counter {
    fn value(&self) -> i32 {
        self.count
    }

    fn increment(&mut self) {
        self.count += 1;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut c = Counter { count: 0 };
    println!("Value: {}", c.value());
    c.increment();
    println!("Value after increment: {}", c.value());
}
```
