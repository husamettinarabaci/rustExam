#### âœ… Answer 1355: Secure communication between host and plugins

Secure communication between the host and plugins prevents data leaks and attacks. In Rust, this can be achieved using IPC (e.g., Unix domain sockets), encrypted channels, or protocol validation.

Example: Communication via Unix domain socket:

```rust
use std::os::unix::net::UnixStream;

fn main() {
    let stream = UnixStream::connect("/tmp/plugin.sock").unwrap();
    // Secure data exchange happens here
}
```
This method creates an isolated and secure channel between the plugin and the host.
