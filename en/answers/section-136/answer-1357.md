To verify the integrity of plugin files, you can use a hash algorithm like SHA-256. In Rust, the `sha2` crate can be used to compute the file's hash and compare it to an expected value. For digital signature verification, crates like `ring` can be used.

```rust
use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{Read, Result};

fn verify_plugin_hash(path: &str, expected_hash: &[u8]) -> Result<bool> {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?;
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 4096];
    loop {
        let n = file.read(&mut buffer)?;
        if n == 0 { break; }
        hasher.update(&buffer[..n]);
    }
    let hash = hasher.finalize();
    Ok(hash.as_slice() == expected_hash)
}
```
This function computes the hash of a plugin file and compares it to the expected hash. If verification fails, the plugin should not be loaded.
