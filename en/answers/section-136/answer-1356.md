To monitor plugin behavior and resource usage, you can assign an ID to each plugin and wrap their execution with a monitoring layer. In Rust, you can time plugin calls and, with external crates (e.g., `sysinfo`), track memory or CPU usage. Here is a basic example:

```rust
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

trait Plugin {
    fn run(&self);
}

struct MonitoredPlugin<P: Plugin> {
    plugin: P,
    id: String,
}

impl<P: Plugin> MonitoredPlugin<P> {
    fn run_with_monitoring(&self) {
        let start = Instant::now();
        // Optionally, add memory usage tracking here
        self.plugin.run();
        let duration = start.elapsed();
        println!("[{}] Execution time: {:?}", self.id, duration);
        // Report resource usage to the main application
    }
}
```
This structure allows you to monitor execution time and other metrics for each plugin. For advanced monitoring, consider OS-level resource limits and detailed measurements.
