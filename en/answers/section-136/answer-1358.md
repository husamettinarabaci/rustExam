To prevent code injection, verify plugin signatures before loading and allow only trusted sources. Restrict the plugin API and consider running plugins in a separate process. In Rust, you can use `std::process::Command` to launch plugins in isolation:

```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn run_plugin_safely(plugin_path: &str) {
    let output = Command::new(plugin_path)
        .arg("--safe-mode")
        .output();
    match output {
        Ok(result) => println!("Plugin output: {:?}", result),
        Err(e) => println!("Failed to start plugin: {}", e),
    }
}
```
This approach runs the plugin in a separate process, allowing you to enforce API restrictions and maintain type safety and boundary checks in the interface.
