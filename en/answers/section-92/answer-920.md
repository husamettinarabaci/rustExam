#### âœ… Answer 920: Best practices for secure systems programming in Rust

Best practices for secure systems programming in Rust include:

- **Minimize unsafe code:** Use `unsafe` only when necessary and encapsulate it in safe abstractions.
- **Memory safety:** Prefer safe Rust constructs; avoid manual memory management.
- **Error handling:** Use `Result` and `Option` for error propagation; avoid panics in production code.
- **Dependency management:** Audit dependencies with `cargo audit` and keep them up to date.
- **Input validation:** Always validate and sanitize external input.
- **Principle of least privilege:** Limit access to only what is necessary.

Example: Encapsulating unsafe code safely

```rust
fn get_unchecked<T>(slice: &[T], idx: usize) -> Option<&T> {
    if idx < slice.len() {
        // Safe wrapper around unsafe access
        Some(unsafe { slice.get_unchecked(idx) })
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

Follow these guidelines to reduce vulnerabilities in systems-level Rust code.
