#### âœ… Answer 917: Auditing Rust code for security vulnerabilities

Auditing Rust code involves checking for unsafe code, dependency vulnerabilities, and logic errors. Use tools like `cargo audit` to scan for vulnerable dependencies, and `clippy` for linting. Manual code review is also essential.

Example: Running `cargo audit` to check for vulnerable crates:

```sh
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo audit
```

This will report any known vulnerabilities in your dependencies. Also, review uses of `unsafe`, error handling, and external crate usage for potential risks.
