#### âœ… Answer 1200: Designing for scalability and resilience

When designing scalable and resilient concurrent systems, consider these principles:
- Shared-nothing architecture (each thread handles its own data)
- Fault isolation (a failure does not affect the whole system)
- Redundant and flexible resource usage
- Automatic restart and monitoring

**Simple architecture diagram:**
```
[Job Queue] -> [Worker 1] -> [Results]
              [Worker 2] -> [Results]
              [Worker N] -> [Results]
```

These principles ensure the system remains robust under load and resilient to failures. They are critical for large-scale web services and microservice architectures.
