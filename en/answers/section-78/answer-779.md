#### âœ… Answer 779: Cross-platform game deployment

The basic steps for cross-platform game deployment in Rust are:

- Use `cargo build --release` to build for the target platform.
- Install platform-specific dependencies (e.g., SDL2, OpenGL) as needed.
- For Windows: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`
- For Linux: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- For macOS: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin`
- Tools like `cross`, `cargo-bundle`, or `cargo-dist` can help with packaging and distribution.

Always test on each platform and ensure all dependencies are included.
