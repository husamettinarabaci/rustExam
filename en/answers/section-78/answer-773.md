This example uses Rust's `std::sync::mpsc` channels to simulate basic multiplayer synchronization. Each player updates their position and sends it to a "server". The server receives updates and could broadcast them to other players. The logic is demonstrated using channels instead of real networking for simplicity.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct PlayerPosition {
    player_id: usize,
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    let server_tx = tx.clone();

    // Simulate players
    for id in 0..3 {
        let tx = tx.clone();
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let pos = PlayerPosition { player_id: id, x: id as f32 * 10.0, y: 0.0 };
            tx.send(pos).unwrap();
        });
    }

    // Simulate server
    thread::spawn(move || {
        for received in rx.iter().take(3) {
            println!("Server received update: {:?}", received);
            // Here, broadcasting to other players could be simulated
        }
    });

    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
}
```
