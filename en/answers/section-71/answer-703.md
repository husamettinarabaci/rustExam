#### âœ… Answer 703: Borrowing mutable data through `RefCell` and tracking runtime panics

With `RefCell<T>`, you can borrow a value mutably at runtime. If you try to borrow mutably more than once at the same time, `RefCell` will panic, enforcing Rust's borrowing rules at runtime.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let cell = RefCell::new(42);
    let mut_ref1 = cell.borrow_mut();
    // let mut_ref2 = cell.borrow_mut(); // This line will panic!
    // Panic message: 'already borrowed: BorrowMutError'
}
```
In the code above, calling `borrow_mut()` a second time causes a panic. The panic message indicates that only one mutable borrow is allowed at a time.
