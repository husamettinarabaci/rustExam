#### âœ… Answer 708: Comparing `RefCell` vs `Mutex` in single-threaded scenarios

Both `RefCell<T>` and `Mutex<T>` allow mutation in a single-threaded context. `RefCell` enforces borrowing rules at runtime, while `Mutex` provides locking. In single-threaded scenarios, `RefCell` is lighter and faster.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let cell = RefCell::new(1);
    *cell.borrow_mut() += 1;
    println!("RefCell: {}", cell.borrow());

    let mutex = Mutex::new(1);
    *mutex.lock().unwrap() += 1;
    println!("Mutex: {}", mutex.lock().unwrap());
}
```

Prefer `RefCell` for single-threaded code. Use `Mutex` when multiple threads are involved.
