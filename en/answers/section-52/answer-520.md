Rust's ownership and borrowing rules ensure memory safety even without a heap. All data is stack-allocated or statically allocated. The type system prevents use-after-free, double free, and buffer overflows. Avoiding dynamic memory allocation reduces fragmentation and runtime errors, making embedded systems more reliable.
