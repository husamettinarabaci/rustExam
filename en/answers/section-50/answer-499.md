During refactoring, proceed in small steps, running tests and compiling at each stage to ensure functionality is preserved. This improves code readability and maintainability.

```rust
// Legacy code
fn sum(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

// Refactored code
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
    }
}
```
