#### âœ… Answer 1072: Using Tokioâ€™s task scheduler effectively

Tokio's task scheduler is responsible for running async tasks efficiently. It uses a work-stealing algorithm to balance the load across worker threads. You can spawn tasks using `tokio::spawn`, and the scheduler will handle their execution. Understanding how tasks are scheduled helps avoid bottlenecks and maximize concurrency.

```rust
use tokio::task;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let handle = task::spawn(async {
        println!("Task running in Tokio scheduler");
    });
    handle.await.unwrap();
}
```
