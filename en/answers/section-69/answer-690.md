#### âœ… Answer 690: Limitations and best practices of declarative macros

This problem explains the limitations and best practices of declarative macros. Declarative macros are insufficient for complex syntax or analysis; in such cases, procedural macros are preferred.

Best practices:
- Use clear and understandable patterns.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Always document your macros.

Example limitation: You cannot add new keywords or perform complex parsing with a declarative macro; use a procedural macro for that.
