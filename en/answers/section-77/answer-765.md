#### âœ… Answer 765: Bootloader development basics

A bootloader is a small program that initializes hardware and loads the main application in embedded systems. Its basic functions:
- Hardware initialization (clock, memory, peripherals)
- Loading the main application to the correct address
- Managing firmware updates

When writing a bootloader in Rust, use `no_std` and custom startup code for low-level memory and hardware access. The bootloader ensures safe and controlled system startup.
