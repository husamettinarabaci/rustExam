#### âœ… Answer 770: Safety-critical embedded software development

Safety-critical software is developed for systems where failure can cause harm or loss. Requirements:
- Deterministic and reliable behavior
- Fault tolerance and safety analysis

Rust's advantages:
- Memory safety (no null pointers, no buffer overflows)
- Strong type system and ownership model

Best practices:
- Use `no_std` and minimal dependencies
- Static analysis and thorough testing
- Code review and formal verification
- Safe API design and avoiding panics

Rust makes it easier to develop safe, error-free code for safety-critical embedded systems.
