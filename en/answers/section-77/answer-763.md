#### âœ… Answer 763: Using DMA in embedded Rust

DMA (Direct Memory Access) allows data transfer without CPU intervention, freeing the processor for other tasks.

Example of starting a DMA transfer in Rust (pseudocode):
```rust
// Configure and start DMA
let dma = dp.DMA1;
dma.start_transfer(src, dst, len);
```
Safety considerations:
- Source and destination memory regions must not overlap
- Do not access data until transfer is complete
- Use DMA interrupts to detect transfer completion

DMA is widely used in embedded systems for high-speed data transfer and low CPU usage.
