#### âœ… Answer 761: Real-time operating systems (RTOS) concepts in Rust

A real-time operating system (RTOS) manages tasks with strict timing constraints. It provides scheduling, task priorities, and deterministic behavior. In embedded systems, RTOS is used for precise timing and reliability.

Typical features:
- Task/thread creation
- Priority-based scheduler
- Context switching via timer interrupts

Advantages:
- Deterministic timing guarantees
- Multitasking
- Resource sharing and synchronization

In Rust, frameworks like `rtic` and `embassy` provide RTOS-like features. For example, RTIC allows easy management of task priorities and scheduling.
