# Levels

## 1. Rustling Initiate
**Foundations: Variables, Functions, Control Flow, Ownership**  
Build the essential foundation in Rust. Learn type system, ownership and borrowing, match statements, and how the compiler helps you write safe code.

## 2. Certified Rustacean
**Intermediate Rust: Structs, Enums, Error Handling, Modules, Crates**  
Learn to design reusable types, organize your code in modules and crates, manage errors idiomatically, and use Rustâ€™s standard collections effectively.

## 3. Builder of Rust Realms
**Applied Rust: Web, CLI, Game Development, Embedded, and WASM**  
Use Rust in real-world applications: write REST APIs with Axum, build interactive CLIs with Clap, develop games using Bevy, program embedded devices, and compile Rust to WebAssembly.

## 4. Master of Rust Internals
**Systems-Level Rust: Unsafe Code, FFI, Macros, Trait Objects, and Compiler Control**  
Dive into low-level capabilities: use unsafe blocks, interface with C code, build macros (`macro_rules!` and procedural), understand trait objects, and learn about MIR and monomorphization.

## 5. Async Commander
**Advanced Concurrency: Async Programming, Tokio, Channels, Actor Models**  
Master Rust's concurrency tools: work with async/await, spawn tasks with Tokio, coordinate with channels, implement actor-based systems, and use thread-safe containers and lock-free structures.

## 6. Architect of Rustverse
**Architectural Rust: Plugins, DSLs, Compile-Time Engines, Fullstack WASM**  
Design scalable and elegant Rust software: implement plugin systems, build embedded DSLs, perform compile-time checks, create fullstack WASM-backed applications, and microservice-based systems.
