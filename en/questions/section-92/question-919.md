#### ❓ Question 919: Building secure network protocols in Rust

Describe how to design and implement secure network protocols in Rust.

- Explain the importance of secure protocol design (e.g., encryption, authentication, integrity).
- Show how to use Rust libraries (such as `rustls` or `tokio`) to implement a secure client or server.
- Optionally, provide a code example of a simple TLS client or server.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate secure network protocol implementation in Rust, focusing on encryption and authentication.
