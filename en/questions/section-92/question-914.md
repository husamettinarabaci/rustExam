#### ❓ Question 914: Implementing secure authentication mechanisms

Write a Rust program or module that demonstrates how to implement secure authentication mechanisms.

- Use Rust's type system and libraries to securely handle user credentials.
- Show how to hash passwords securely (e.g., using `argon2` or `bcrypt`).
- Demonstrate how to verify a password during login.
- Optionally, show how to use tokens (JWT or similar) for session management.

🔧 **Task:** Build a secure authentication flow in Rust, focusing on password hashing and verification.
