#### ❓ Question 911: Writing memory-safe cryptographic code

Write a Rust function that implements a simple cryptographic operation (e.g., XOR cipher) in a memory-safe way:

- Accept a byte slice and a key byte as input.
- Return a new `Vec<u8>` where each byte is XORed with the key.
- Ensure no unsafe code is used.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a memory-safe XOR cipher function in Rust.
