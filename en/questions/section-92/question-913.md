#### ❓ Question 913: Using Rust’s type system for secure APIs

Explain how Rust’s type system can be used to design secure APIs:

- How can types prevent misuse of sensitive data or operations?
- Give an example of using newtypes or enums to restrict API usage.
- Show how the borrow checker helps enforce security boundaries.

🔧 **Task:** Provide a brief explanation and a Rust example using types to enforce security.
