#### ❓ Question 992: Using `const generics` and generic associated types

Write a Rust code example that demonstrates the use of const generics or generic associated types (GATs).

- Use a feature that requires enabling `#![feature(const_generics)]` or `#![feature(generic_associated_types)]`.
- Show how const generics or GATs can be used to make code more flexible or type-safe.
- Explain how to enable and run the code with nightly Rust.

🔧 **Task:** Provide a minimal example using const generics or GATs, and instructions for running it with the nightly toolchain.
