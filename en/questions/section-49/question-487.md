#### ❓ Question 487: Managing state with `Arc` and shared data

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Use `Arc` and an appropriate synchronization type to share a value (like a counter) across the application.
- Provide an endpoint to read and/or update this value.
- Pass the shared state to the handler function.

🔧 **Task:** Use Axum to manage shared, updatable state with `Arc`.
