#### ❓ Question 482: Defining routes with handlers and parameters

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a route `/hello/:name` that responds with a personalized greeting using the `name` parameter from the URL.
- Create a route `/sum/:a/:b` that takes two numbers from the URL, adds them, and returns the result.
- Implement appropriate handler functions for both routes.

🔧 **Task:** Use Axum to define parameterized routes and handler functions that generate dynamic responses.
