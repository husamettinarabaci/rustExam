#### ❓ Question 489: Structuring routes with `Router::nest`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a nested router under `/api` that contains multiple endpoints.
- Add this nested router to the main router.
- Write separate handler functions for each endpoint.

🔧 **Task:** Use Axum's `Router::nest` to create nested routers and add them to the main router.
