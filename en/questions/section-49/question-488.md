#### ❓ Question 488: Handling errors and creating custom responses

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- In an endpoint, return either an error or a success response based on an incoming parameter.
- On error, return a custom error message and appropriate HTTP status code.
- Use Rust's `Result` type and Axum's response types.

🔧 **Task:** Create an Axum endpoint that demonstrates error handling and custom responses.
