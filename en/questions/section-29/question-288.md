#### ❓ Question 288: Understanding exhaustive pattern matching requirements

Do the following:

- Write a short example that demonstrates Rust's requirement for exhaustive pattern matching in `match` expressions.
- Include a code sample that triggers a compiler error due to missing match arms.
- Provide a corrected example that covers all possible variants.

🔧 **Task:** Show how Rust enforces exhaustive pattern matching and the compiler's behavior when not all cases are handled.
