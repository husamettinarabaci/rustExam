#### ❓ Question 283: Destructuring structs and tuples in match arms

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a struct and a tuple.
- In a function, use `match` to destructure both the struct and the tuple, accessing their fields/elements and producing different outputs.
- Print output for at least two different struct and tuple variants.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate pattern matching and destructuring on structs and tuples using match arms.
