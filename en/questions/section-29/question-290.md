#### ❓ Question 290: Pattern matching in deeply nested data structures

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a data structure with nested structs and enums.
- Create an instance and use `match` with nested pattern matching to extract and print the innermost value.
- Use at least two levels of nested data structures and pattern matching.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example demonstrating pattern matching in deeply nested data structures.
