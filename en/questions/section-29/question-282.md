#### ❓ Question 282: Using `if let` and `while let` for concise pattern matching

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an enum with several different variants.
- In a function, use `if let` to check for a specific variant and print a message.
- Use `while let` to iterate over a vector or array of enum values, matching and printing output for each relevant variant.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate concise and effective pattern matching using `if let` and `while let`.
