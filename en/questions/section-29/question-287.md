#### ❓ Question 287: Using `@` bindings in match arms

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an integer variable and assign it a value.
- Use a `match` statement to check this variable.
- If the value is between 10 and 20 (inclusive), bind the value to a variable (e.g., `n @ 10..=20`) and print "In range: n".
- If the value is 0, print "Zero".
- For all other values, print "Out of range".
- Use the `@` binding to both match the range and use the matched value in the output.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `@` binding in match arms to match a range and use the value in the output.
