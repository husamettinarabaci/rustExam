#### ❓ Question 281: Pattern matching on enums and extracting nested data

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a data model with nested enums (for example, an enum containing another enum as a field).
- Use pattern matching in a function to access inner data from these enums and produce different outputs.
- Print output for at least two different nested enum variants.

🔧 **Task:** Use pattern matching on enums to destructure nested data and produce appropriate output.
