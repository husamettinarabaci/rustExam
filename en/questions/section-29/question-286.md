#### ❓ Question 286: Combining patterns with `|` and `_`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an integer variable and assign it a value.
- Use a `match` statement to check this variable.
- If the value is 1, 3, or 5, print "Odd and Small".
- If the value is 2 or 4, print "Even and Small".
- If the value is 6, 7, or 8, print "Medium".
- For all other values (wildcard pattern `_`), print "Other".
- Use `|` to combine multiple patterns and `_` as a wildcard in match arms.

🔧 **Task:** Use `|` to combine multiple patterns and `_` as a wildcard in match arms to produce different outputs.
