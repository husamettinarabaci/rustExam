#### ❓ Question 289: Pattern matching with references and mutability

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an integer variable and use pattern matching with both reference and mutable reference to print its value.
- Use `match` with both `ref` and `ref mut` patterns.
- Print the value of the variable to the terminal in both cases.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example demonstrating pattern matching with reference and mutable reference.
