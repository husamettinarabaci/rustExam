#### ❓ Question 266: Using lifetime elision rules and understanding when they fail

Follow these steps to demonstrate how Rust's lifetime elision rules work and when they fail:

- Briefly explain what lifetime elision rules are.
- Write a function example where lifetime elision works automatically.
- Write a function example where elision fails and the compiler requires explicit lifetime annotations.
- Explain why the code behaves this way in both cases.

🔧 **Task:** Show, with examples, how lifetime elision rules work and when explicit lifetimes are required.
