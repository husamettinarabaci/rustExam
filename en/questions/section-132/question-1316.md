#### ❓ Question 1316: Compiling DSLs to intermediate representations

Write an example that compiles a DSL expression to an intermediate representation (like an AST):

- Tokenize a DSL expression in Rust.
- Build a simple abstract syntax tree (AST) from the tokens.
- Print the AST.

🔧 **Task:** Write a basic example in Rust that converts a DSL expression to an AST.
