#### ❓ Question 1317: Optimizing DSL runtime performance

Write an example to improve runtime performance in a DSL interpreter:

- Pre-parse DSL expressions into an AST.
- Use a cache (e.g., HashMap) to avoid repeated computations on the AST.
- Demonstrate the performance gain with an example.

🔧 **Task:** Write a Rust example that uses caching to optimize DSL interpreter performance.
