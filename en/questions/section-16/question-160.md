#### ❓ Question 160: Implementing generic traits for multiple types

Define a generic trait and implement it for two different types. Show how the trait can be used with both types.

- Create a trait named `Summable` with a method `sum`.
- Implement `Summable` for `Vec<i32>` and `[i32; 3]`.

🔧 **Task:** Use generic traits to provide shared functionality for different types.
