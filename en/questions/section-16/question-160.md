#### ❓ Question 160: Vector of structs

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to create and use a vector of structs.

- Define a simple struct (e.g., `Person` with `name` and `age`).
- Create a vector containing several instances of the struct.
- Iterate over the vector and print each struct's fields.

🔧 **Task:** Use a vector to store multiple struct instances and display their contents.
