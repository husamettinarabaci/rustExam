#### ❓ Question 509: Managing task cancellation and graceful shutdown

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Start an async task that runs for a long time (e.g., with a loop).
- Cancel this task from the main task.
- Print a message when the task is cancelled.

🔧 **Task:** Cancel a long-running async task and show that it shuts down gracefully.
