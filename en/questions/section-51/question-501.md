#### ❓ Question 501: Creating an async function and awaiting a future

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a function using the `async` keyword.
- The function should return a value and produce a future when called.
- In the `main` function, call this async function and await its result.
- Print the result to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Create a simple async function and print its result by awaiting it.
