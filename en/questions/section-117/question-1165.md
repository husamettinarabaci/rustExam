#### ❓ Question 1165: Using thread-local storage

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Each thread has its own thread-local variable.
- Threads read and modify this variable.
- The main thread ensures each worker thread prints its own thread-local value.

🔧 **Task:** Use thread-local storage to store and use data unique to each thread.
