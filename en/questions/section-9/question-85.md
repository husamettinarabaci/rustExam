#### ❓ Question 85: Tuple structs and unit-like structs

Write a Rust program that demonstrates tuple structs and unit-like structs.

- Define a tuple struct named `Color` with three `u8` fields.
- Define a unit-like struct named `Marker`.
- Create an instance of `Color` and assign values.
- Create an instance of `Marker`.
- Print the values of the `Color` instance to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use tuple structs and unit-like structs in Rust.
