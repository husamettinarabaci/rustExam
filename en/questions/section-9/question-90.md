#### ❓ Question 90: Structs with associated functions

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of associated functions with structs.

- Define a struct of your choice (e.g., `Rectangle`).
- Implement an associated function (e.g., `new`) for the struct using `impl`.
- Use the associated function to create an instance of the struct in `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use an associated function (constructor) for a struct in Rust.
