#### ❓ Question 302: Using enums to model states and transitions

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an enum representing different states of a process (e.g., Started, InProgress, Completed, Error).
- Use this enum to update the state of a variable and print a different message for each state.
- Use a `match` statement to handle state transitions and print the appropriate message.

🔧 **Task:** Model the states and transitions of a process using an enum, and print a message for each state.
