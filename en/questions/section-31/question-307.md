#### ❓ Question 307: Modeling domain logic with algebraic data types

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Model a shopping cart using an enum and structs. The cart should be able to contain multiple products (name and price).
- Create an enum for the cart items: `CartItem` (e.g., `Product { name: String, price: f64 }` and `Empty`).
- Represent the cart as a vector and write a function to calculate the total price.
- In the `main` function, create a sample cart and print the total price.

🔧 **Task:** Model a shopping cart with algebraic data types and compute the total price.
