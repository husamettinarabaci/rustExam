#### ❓ Question 301: Defining custom enums with data-carrying variants

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an enum with at least three variants, each carrying different types of data.
- Create several instances of this enum.
- Use a `match` statement to destructure each variant and print the contained data to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Define a custom enum with data-carrying variants and print their contents by matching on each variant.
