#### ❓ Question 304: Matching enum variants with shared logic

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an enum with multiple variants (for example, a `Message` enum: `Quit`, `Move`, `Write`, `ChangeColor`).
- Use different data types for each variant.
- Implement a function or method that matches on all variants and applies shared logic (for example, printing a message to the screen).
- In the `main` function, create instances of different variants and call the function/method to show the output.

🔧 **Task:** Process enum variants with a shared function/logic and demonstrate with examples.
