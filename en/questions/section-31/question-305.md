#### ❓ Question 305: Creating recursive enums using Box

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an enum with at least one variant that contains a value of its own type.
- Use `Box` to enable the enum to be recursive.
- Create an instance of the enum with multiple nested variants.
- Write a function that prints or traverses all values in the recursive structure (for example, recursively printing all values).

🔧 **Task:** Define a recursive enum using `Box` and implement a function to process the recursive data structure.
