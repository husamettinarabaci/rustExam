#### ❓ Question 306: Using enums for state machines and transitions

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Model a traffic light state machine using an enum with at least three variants: `Red`, `Yellow`, `Green`.
- Implement a method `next` for the enum that returns the next state based on the current state.
- In the `main` function, initialize a traffic light state and call the `next` method several times, printing the state at each step.

🔧 **Task:** Use an enum and method to create a simple traffic light state machine.
