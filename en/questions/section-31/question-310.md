#### ❓ Question 310: Pattern-matching enums with guards and bindings

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define an enum and add data to some of its variants.
- Use a function to perform `match` pattern matching on the enum.
- In the match arms, use both a guard (with `if`) and an `@` binding to produce different outputs based on conditions.

🔧 **Task:** Write example code that uses both a guard and an `@` binding when matching on an enum.
