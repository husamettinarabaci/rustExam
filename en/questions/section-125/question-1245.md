#### ❓ Question 1245: Fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms

Explain how to implement fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms in Rust for high-assurance systems.

- Define fault tolerance and recovery in the context of software systems.
- Describe Rust features (e.g., `Result`, error handling, retries) that support these mechanisms.
- Provide a code example showing error handling and recovery.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate fault tolerance and recovery in Rust code.
