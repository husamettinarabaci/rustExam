#### ❓ Question 1246: Real-time constraints and scheduling guarantees

Discuss how Rust can be used to meet real-time constraints and provide scheduling guarantees in high-assurance systems.

- Define real-time constraints and why they matter.
- Explain how Rust's features (e.g., predictable memory usage, no GC) help with real-time systems.
- Optionally, show a code example or mention a real-time Rust framework.

🔧 **Task:** Explain and demonstrate Rust's suitability for real-time and scheduled systems.
