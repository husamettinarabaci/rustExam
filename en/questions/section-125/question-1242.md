#### ❓ Question 1242: Using contracts and invariants in Rust code

Describe how to use contracts (preconditions, postconditions) and invariants in Rust to improve code safety.

- Explain the concept of contracts and invariants in software.
- Show how to express or enforce them in Rust (e.g., with assertions or external tools).
- Provide a code example demonstrating a function with explicit contract checks.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate contract and invariant enforcement in Rust code.
