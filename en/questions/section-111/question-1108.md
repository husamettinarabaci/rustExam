#### ❓ Question 1108: Testing message-passing concurrency

Write a Rust program and a test function that does the following:

- Create a channel with one producer and one consumer.
- The producer should send a fixed number of messages.
- The consumer should verify that all messages are received in order.
- Write a unit test function to ensure correct message-passing concurrency.

🔧 **Task:** Write a unit test function that tests message delivery and order over a channel.
