#### ❓ Question 529: Detecting collisions in 2D environments

Follow these steps to write a simple collision detection system in Bevy for a 2D environment:

- Add position and size information to entities (e.g., `Transform` and a custom `Size` component).
- In a system, check for overlaps between entities.
- Perform an action when a collision is detected (e.g., print a message).

🔧 **Task:** Write a system that checks if two entities collide in a 2D environment.
