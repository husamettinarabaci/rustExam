#### ❓ Question 752: Using atomic types with `std::sync::atomic`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Demonstrate usage of different atomic types (`AtomicBool`, `AtomicIsize`, `AtomicUsize`, etc.) from the `std::sync::atomic` module.
- Show basic read, write, and update operations for each atomic type.
- Include an example of thread-safe usage with multiple threads for at least one atomic variable.

🔧 **Task:** Write examples showing basic operations and thread-safe usage of different atomic types.
