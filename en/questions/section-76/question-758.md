#### ❓ Question 758: Writing async-aware synchronization primitives

How do you write a custom synchronization primitive (e.g., async mutex) for async environments in Rust?

- Explain why async-specific synchronization primitives are needed.
- Provide a simple example of an async mutex or semaphore.
- Describe the differences between sync and async primitives.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate a basic async synchronization primitive for async environments.
