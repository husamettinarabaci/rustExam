#### ❓ Question 753: Designing concurrent queues and stacks

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to design a lock-free queue or stack:

- Implement a concurrent queue or stack using atomic types (e.g., `AtomicPtr`, `AtomicUsize`).
- Ensure that multiple threads can push and pop elements concurrently without using locks.
- Show how to handle memory safety and ABA problems.

🔧 **Task:** Build a minimal lock-free queue or stack in Rust and explain the key safety considerations.
