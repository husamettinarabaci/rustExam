#### ❓ Question 755: Using `RwLock` for optimized read access

Write a Rust example that uses `RwLock` to optimize read and write operations:

- Create a scenario where multiple threads can read data simultaneously, but only one can write at a time.
- Demonstrate how `RwLock`'s read and write locks work.
- Explain the advantages of `RwLock` in read-heavy workloads.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a multithreaded example using `RwLock` for managing read and write access, and explain its benefits.
