#### ❓ Question 751: Implementing lock-free data structures

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Implement a lock-free counter data structure.
- Add functions to increment and read the counter value.
- Use the `std::sync::atomic` module to ensure thread-safe operation across multiple threads.
- Demonstrate concurrent increments from multiple threads and verify the result.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a lock-free counter using atomic types and show with an example that it works correctly with multiple threads.
