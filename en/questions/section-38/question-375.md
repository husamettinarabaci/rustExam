#### ❓ Question 375: Transferring ownership vs borrowing

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a vector and pass it to a function by transferring ownership.
- Pass the same vector to another function by borrowing (using a reference).
- Show that after transferring ownership, trying to use the original variable results in a compiler error.
- Show that after borrowing, you can still use the original variable after the function call.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate the fundamental difference between ownership transfer and borrowing with example code.
