#### ❓ Question 372: Returning owned values from functions

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a string variable and pass it to a function by value (transferring ownership).
- The function should perform an operation on the string (e.g., append a suffix) and return ownership back to the caller.
- In `main`, use the returned string variable and print it to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how ownership can be transferred to a function, processed, and then returned to the caller, allowing further use in the calling scope.
