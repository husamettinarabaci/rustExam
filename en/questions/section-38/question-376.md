#### ❓ Question 376: Avoiding double moves and use-after-move errors

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Attempt to transfer the same vector again to another function and observe the compiler error.
- Show the error that occurs when trying to use the vector after it has been moved.
- Explain how to avoid such errors.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate double move and use-after-move errors with example code and explanation.
