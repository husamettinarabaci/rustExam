#### ❓ Question 378: Returning references from functions (with lifetimes)

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to safely return a reference from a function:

- Define a function that returns a reference to the first element of a vector.
- Use correct lifetime annotations in the function signature.
- Also provide an example that would cause a compile error due to incorrect lifetime usage.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use lifetime annotations when returning references from functions, and demonstrate a compile error when used incorrectly.
