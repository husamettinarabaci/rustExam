#### ❓ Question 377: Returning references from functions (with lifetimes)

Write a Rust function that does the following:

- Returns a reference to a value or element from a collection or variable via a function.
- Uses lifetime annotation in the function signature.
- Ensures no dangling reference is created.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example that safely returns a reference from a function using lifetime annotations.
