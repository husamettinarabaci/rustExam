#### ❓ Question 379: Understanding ownership of slices and references

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Create a slice from a vector and pass it as a reference to a function.
- Show that the function does not take ownership of the slice and the original vector can still be used after the function call.
- Include a brief explanation highlighting the difference between references and ownership.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate the ownership rules of slices and references, and how they behave when passed to functions.
