#### ❓ Question 374: Borrowing values mutably in parameters

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a function that takes a vector (`Vec<i32>`) as a mutable reference parameter.
- The function should add a number (e.g., 42) to the vector.
- In `main`, create a vector, call the function, and print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Pass a vector to a function as a mutable reference and modify it inside the function.
