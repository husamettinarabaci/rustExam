#### ❓ Question 380: Writing ownership-aware APIs

Design a Rust API that meets the following requirements:

- Define one or more functions that clearly demonstrate ownership, borrowing, and lifetime rules.
- Your API should include functions that take ownership, borrow by reference, and/or use lifetime annotations.
- Allow the user to operate on a collection or data structure in a way that respects Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.
- Include a short usage example.

🔧 **Task:** Write a safe and idiomatic Rust API that clearly demonstrates ownership and borrowing rules at function boundaries.
