#### ❓ Question 122: Using `mod` and `use` for organization

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to organize code using `mod` and `use` in the same file.

- Define a module named `math` with a function `add` that takes two `i32` parameters and returns their sum.
- In the main function, use the `use` keyword to bring `math::add` into scope.
- Call `add` in `main` to add two numbers and print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to declare a module and use `mod` and `use` for better code organization in a single Rust file.
