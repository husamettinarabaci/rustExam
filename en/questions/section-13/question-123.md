#### ❓ Question 123: Splitting code into multiple files

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to split code into multiple files using modules.

- Create a module named `utils` and move its implementation to a separate file named `utils.rs`.
- In `utils.rs`, define a public function `greet` that prints `Hello from utils!`.
- In your main file, use `mod utils;` to include the module and call `utils::greet()` from `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to organize Rust code by splitting modules into separate files and using them in your main program.
