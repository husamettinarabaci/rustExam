#### ❓ Question 557: Async error handling strategies

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a scenario where multiple async operations can fail.
- Use `Result` and the `?` operator to manage errors.
- Propagate errors to the top level and handle them appropriately in `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example that demonstrates error handling and propagation in async functions.
