#### ❓ Question 553: Managing task priorities and cancellation

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Start two async tasks with different priorities (e.g., one completes faster).
- Use a mechanism (such as a channel or flag) to cancel one of the tasks.
- Print which task completed or was cancelled.

🔧 **Task:** Implement an example that simulates task priority and cancellation in async Rust.
