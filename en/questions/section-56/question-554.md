#### ❓ Question 554: Building async retry and backoff mechanisms

Write a Rust function that does the following:

- Simulate an async operation (e.g., a fallible HTTP request).
- If the operation fails, retry a certain number of times.
- Use exponential backoff (increase wait time after each failure).
- Print whether the operation eventually succeeded or failed.

🔧 **Task:** Implement retry and backoff logic in an async function.
