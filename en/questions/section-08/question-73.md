#### ❓ Question 73: Lifetime elision rules

Write a Rust function that takes a string slice and returns its length as an integer. Explain why you do not need to explicitly annotate lifetimes in this function signature, referring to Rust's lifetime elision rules.

- Define a function that accepts a `&str` parameter and returns its length.
- Do not use explicit lifetime annotations in the function signature.
- Explain in comments or as part of the answer why this is allowed.
- Demonstrate usage in `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how Rust's lifetime elision rules allow you to omit explicit lifetime annotations in simple cases.
