#### ❓ Question 77: Lifetime in method receivers

Write a Rust struct and implement a method that uses lifetime annotations in its receiver:

- Define a struct that holds a string slice reference (`&str`) with a lifetime parameter.
- Implement a method for the struct that returns the length of the referenced string.
- Annotate the method receiver with the correct lifetime.
- Demonstrate usage in `main` by creating an instance and calling the method.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use lifetime annotations in method receivers for structs with reference fields.
