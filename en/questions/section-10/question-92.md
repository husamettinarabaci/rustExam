#### ❓ Question 92: Associated functions (constructors)

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to define and use associated functions (constructors) for a struct.

- Define a struct (e.g., `Person`).
- Implement an associated function (e.g., `new`) for the struct using `impl`.
- In `main`, use the associated function to create an instance of the struct.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use a constructor (associated function) for a struct in Rust.
