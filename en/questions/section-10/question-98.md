#### ❓ Question 98: Method with trait bounds

Write a Rust method that uses a trait bound in its implementation.

- Define a struct and implement a method for it that only works if a generic type parameter implements a specific trait (e.g., `Display`).
- Demonstrate calling this method with a type that satisfies the trait bound.

🔧 **Task:** Use a trait bound (such as `T: Display`) in a method implementation and show how it restricts usage to types that implement the trait.
