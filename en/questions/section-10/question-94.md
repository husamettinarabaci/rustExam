#### ❓ Question 94: Method returning a value

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to define a method for a struct that returns a value.

- Define a struct (e.g., `Square`).
- Implement a method (e.g., `area`) that returns a value (e.g., the area of the square).
- In `main`, create an instance and call the method, printing the result.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use a method that returns a value from a struct in Rust.
