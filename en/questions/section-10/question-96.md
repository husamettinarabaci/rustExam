#### ❓ Question 96: Method returning self

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to define a method for a struct that returns `Self` (the struct itself).

- Define a struct (e.g., `Multiplier`).
- Implement a method (e.g., `double`) that returns a new instance of the struct with modified data.
- In `main`, create an instance, call the method, and print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use a method that returns `Self` for a struct in Rust.
