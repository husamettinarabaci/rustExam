#### ❓ Question 93: Method taking `&self` and `&mut self`

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to define methods for a struct that take `&self` and `&mut self` as parameters.

- Define a struct (e.g., `Counter`).
- Implement a method that takes `&self` (e.g., `value`) and another that takes `&mut self` (e.g., `increment`).
- In `main`, create an instance, call both methods, and print the results.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use both immutable and mutable methods for a struct in Rust.
