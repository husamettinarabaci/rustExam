### 🔹 Category: Method chaining  
#### ❓ Question 95: Method chaining

Write a Rust program that demonstrates method chaining with a struct.

- Define a struct (e.g., `Builder`).
- Implement methods that return `&mut self` to allow chaining (e.g., `set_x`, `set_y`).
- In `main`, create an instance and chain method calls to set values, then print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to implement and use method chaining for a struct in Rust.
