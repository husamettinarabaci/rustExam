#### ❓ Question 91: Implementing methods with `impl`

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to implement methods for a struct using an `impl` block.

- Define a struct (e.g., `Circle`).
- Implement at least one method (e.g., `area`) for the struct using `impl`.
- In `main`, create an instance of the struct and call the method.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use methods for a struct in Rust using the `impl` block.
