#### ❓ Question 592: Managing concurrency with lock-free data structures

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Implement a lock-free counter or a simple data structure using atomic types.
- Prevent data races using atomic operations.
- Test the implementation with multiple threads.

🔧 **Task:** Design a lock-free data structure using atomics and demonstrate thread safety with a multi-threaded test.
