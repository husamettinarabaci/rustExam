#### ❓ Question 2: Adding a comment in Rust

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Add a single-line comment above the `main` function.
- The comment should describe what the program does.
- The `main` function should print `This is a comment example.` to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Use Rust's single-line comment syntax (`//`) to document your code.
