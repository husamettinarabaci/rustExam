#### ❓ Question 3: Difference between `let` and `const` in Rust

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the difference between a variable declared with `let` and a constant declared with `const`.

- Declare a mutable variable `x` with `let` and assign it a value.
- Declare a constant `Y` with `const` and assign it a value.
- Change the value of `x` and print both `x` and `Y` to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Show how `let` and `const` are used differently in Rust, and explain their key differences in your code comments.
