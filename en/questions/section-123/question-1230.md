#### ❓ Question 1230: Designing efficient schema evolutions

Write a Rust program or explanation that does the following:

- Provide a design example that makes serialized data robust to schema changes.
- Explain how you ensure compatibility without data loss when adding, removing, or renaming fields.
- Use `serde` attributes or custom solutions as needed.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate an efficient and compatible serialization/deserialization strategy for schema evolution.
