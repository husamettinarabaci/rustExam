#### ❓ Question 1226: Performance benchmarking of serializers

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Serialize the same data structure using `serde_json`, `bincode`, and `ciborium`.
- Measure the time taken and output size for each serialization.
- Print and briefly compare the results.

🔧 **Task:** Write a benchmark to compare the speed and output size of different serializers.
