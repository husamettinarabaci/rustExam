#### ❓ Question 1229: Serialization in distributed systems

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Choose an appropriate serialization format for data transfer between multiple machines (e.g., MessagePack or CBOR).
- Serialize a struct, send it over a TCP connection, and deserialize it on the other end.
