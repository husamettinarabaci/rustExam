#### ❓ Question 1223: Zero-copy deserialization techniques

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Perform zero-copy deserialization from a byte slice (e.g., JSON or MessagePack data).
- Use an appropriate crate (such as `serde_bytes` or `serde_cbor`) to convert the data into a struct without copying memory.
- Explain in code comments how zero-copy is achieved.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example using the right crate and techniques for zero-copy deserialization.
