#### ❓ Question 1225: Streaming serialization for large datasets

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Serialize a large collection (e.g., a vector) to a file or memory in a streaming fashion (piece by piece).
- Deserialize the data back in a streaming manner.
- Use an appropriate crate (such as `serde_json::Serializer` or `ciborium::ser::into_writer`).

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate streaming serialization and deserialization for large datasets.
