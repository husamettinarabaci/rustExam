#### ❓ Question 1221: Using `serde` for serialization

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a data structure (e.g., a struct).
- Use the `serde` and `serde_json` crates to serialize and deserialize this structure in JSON format.
- Print the serialized JSON output to the screen.
- Demonstrate deserializing from JSON back into the struct.

🔧 **Task:** Practice basic serialization and deserialization using `serde` and `serde_json`.
