#### ❓ Question 1227: Versioning and backward compatibility

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define old and new versions of a struct (e.g., add a new field in the new version).
- Deserialize data serialized with the old version into the new struct.
- Explain how backward compatibility is achieved.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate compatibility in serialization/deserialization when struct versions change.
