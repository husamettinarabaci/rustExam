#### ❓ Question 543: Using `unsafe` to manipulate raw pointers

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a raw pointer (`*const` or `*mut`) to a variable.
- Use an unsafe block to read and/or write through the pointer.
- Print the result to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate reading and writing with a raw pointer in an unsafe block in Rust.
