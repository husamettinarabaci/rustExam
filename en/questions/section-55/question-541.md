#### ❓ Question 541: Writing a basic memory allocator (bump allocator)

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Implement a simple bump allocator that simulates memory allocation.
- Operate on a static byte array or vector.
- Provide a function to allocate a new block and update the current position.
- Check for out-of-bounds and return an error if necessary.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate the core logic of a bump allocator in Rust using a static memory region.
