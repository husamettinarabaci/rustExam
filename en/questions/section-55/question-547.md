#### ❓ Question 547: Inspecting memory layout with `std::mem::size_of`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Print the memory size of different types (e.g., i32, f64, struct).
- Use the `std::mem::size_of` function.
- Print the results to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example that measures the memory size of different types in Rust.
