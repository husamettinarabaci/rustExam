#### ❓ Question 725: Demonstrating overlapping implementations and compiler rejections

Write a Rust example that attempts to create overlapping trait implementations for the same type or trait bound, and observe the compiler's rejection.

- Define a trait and try to implement it for overlapping types (e.g., both for `T` and for `&T`).
- Show the error message or explain why the compiler rejects overlapping implementations.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate how Rust prevents overlapping trait implementations and explain the coherence rules involved.
