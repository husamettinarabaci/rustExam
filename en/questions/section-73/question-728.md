#### ❓ Question 728: Creating generic traits with associated types and default bounds

Write a Rust trait that demonstrates:

- The use of associated types in a generic trait.
- Providing a default bound for the associated type.
- Implementing the trait for a custom type and overriding the associated type if needed.

🔧 **Task:** Define a generic trait with an associated type and a default bound, and implement it for a struct.
