#### ❓ Question 723: Using negative trait bounds with `#![feature(negative_impls)]` (nightly only)

Write a Rust example that does the following:

- Demonstrates the use of negative trait bounds (e.g., specifying that a type does not implement a trait).
- Explain that this feature is only available on nightly Rust and how to enable it.
- Provide an example showing how it works.

🔧 **Task:** Create an example and explanation for negative trait bounds in Rust.
