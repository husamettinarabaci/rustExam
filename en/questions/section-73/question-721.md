#### ❓ Question 721: Implementing traits with complex bounds and `where` clauses

Write a Rust function or trait implementation that does the following:

- Defines a function or trait implementation with multiple trait bounds.
- Uses a `where` clause to make the bounds more readable.
- Provide an example showing how the function or trait implementation works.

🔧 **Task:** Create an example of implementing traits with complex bounds and `where` clauses.
