#### ❓ Question 726: Using blanket implementations and controlling trait resolution

Write a Rust example that demonstrates:

- How to use a blanket implementation (e.g., `impl<T: Trait> AnotherTrait for T`).
- How blanket implementations can conflict with more specific implementations.
- How Rust resolves trait implementations in the presence of blanket and specific impls.

🔧 **Task:** Show how blanket implementations work and explain how Rust chooses which implementation to use.
