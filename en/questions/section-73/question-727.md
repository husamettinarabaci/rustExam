#### ❓ Question 727: Restricting trait implementations with sealed traits

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use the sealed trait pattern to restrict trait implementations:

- Define a public trait that should only be implemented within a specific module or crate.
- Use a private "sealed" trait to prevent external implementations.
- Show how this pattern enforces implementation restrictions.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a sealed trait pattern to control which types can implement a public trait.
