#### ❓ Question 204: Calling trait methods

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to call trait methods on types that implement a trait.

- Define a trait named `Describable` with a method `describe()` that returns a `String`.
- Implement the `Describable` trait for at least two structs, such as `Book` and `Car`.
- In `main`, create instances of both structs and call their `describe()` methods.
- Print the returned descriptions to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define a trait, implement it for multiple types, and call the trait methods on those types in Rust.
