#### ❓ Question 205: Implementing traits for external types

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to implement a trait for a type defined outside your crate (an external type).

- Define a trait named `Printable` with a method `print_value()` that prints the value.
- Implement the `Printable` trait for the external type `i32`.
- In `main`, call `print_value()` on an `i32` value.
- Note: You can only implement your own traits for external types, not external traits for external types.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to extend the functionality of external types in Rust by implementing your own trait for them.
