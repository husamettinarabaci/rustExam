#### ❓ Question 202: Default methods in traits

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to define a trait with a default method implementation.

- Define a trait with at least one method that has a default implementation.
- Implement this trait for a struct, overriding the default method in one case and using the default in another.
- Show how to call both the overridden and default methods.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate the use of default methods in Rust traits and how they can be overridden or used as-is in implementations.
