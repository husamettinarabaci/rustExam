#### ❓ Question 358: Chaining closures with iterator methods

Write a Rust program that demonstrates chaining closures with iterator methods by following these steps:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Define a closure that multiplies each element by two.
- Use this closure with `map` to create a new vector.
- Print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Apply a transformation to a vector by chaining closures with iterator methods.
