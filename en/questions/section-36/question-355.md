#### ❓ Question 355: Storing a closure as a struct field

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Store a closure as a field inside a struct.
- The struct should have a method that calls the closure.
- The closure should take an integer and return an integer.
- In `main`, create an instance of the struct and use the closure to compute a value.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a struct that stores a closure as a field and provides a method to call it.
