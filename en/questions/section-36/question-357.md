#### ❓ Question 357: Partial application with closures

Write a Rust program that demonstrates partial application using closures by following these steps:

- Define a function that adds two integers.
- Create a closure that fixes the first parameter of this function (for example, a closure that always adds 10).
- Call this closure with different values and print the results.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate partial application by creating a closure that fixes some parameters of a function.
