#### ❓ Question 356: Creating a pipeline with closures and functions

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Chain multiple closures and functions to form a processing pipeline.
- Each closure or function should take an integer and return an integer.
- Pass a value through all steps in the pipeline in sequence.
- Print the final result in `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Build a data processing pipeline by chaining closures and functions, and display the result.
