#### ❓ Question 353: Using `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` trait bounds

Write an example demonstrating how to use `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` trait bounds when passing a closure as a function parameter:

- Define separate functions that accept closures with each of the three trait bounds.
- Create appropriate closure examples to call each function.
- Briefly explain when each trait is used.

🔧 **Task:** Show the difference between `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` trait bounds in functions that take closures as parameters, with examples.
