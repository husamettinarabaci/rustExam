#### ❓ Question 1042: Using `Pin` and `Unpin` in async code

Write Rust code that does the following:

- Use `Pin` to prevent a future from being moved.
- Show when the `Unpin` trait is automatically implemented.
- Pin a future with `Pin<Box<T>>` and demonstrate that it cannot be moved.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use the `Pin` and `Unpin` traits in async code with an example.
