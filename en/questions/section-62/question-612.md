#### ❓ Question 612: Parsing Rust syntax with `syn` crate

Write a Rust procedural macro that uses the `syn` crate to parse Rust syntax:

- Create a procedural macro that parses a struct definition using the `syn` crate.
- Print or log the name of the struct and its fields during macro expansion.
- Demonstrate how to use the macro on a sample struct.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `syn` crate to parse Rust syntax in a procedural macro and extract information from a struct definition.
