#### ❓ Question 619: Macro-driven code for serialization/deserialization

Write a Rust procedural macro that generates serialization and deserialization code:

- Create a derive macro that implements `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits for a struct.
- The macro should generate code for converting the struct to and from a string or another format.
- Show how to use the macro on a sample struct.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a procedural macro that automates serialization and deserialization for user-defined types.
