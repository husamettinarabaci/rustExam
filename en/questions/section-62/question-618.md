#### ❓ Question 618: Combining procedural and declarative macros

Write an example that combines procedural macros and declarative (`macro_rules!`) macros in Rust:

- Define both a procedural macro and a declarative macro.
- Show usage where a declarative macro calls a procedural macro, or vice versa.
- Briefly explain how the two macro types can work together.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate with code how procedural and declarative macros can be used together in Rust.
