#### ❓ Question 65: Copy types vs. move types

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the difference between Copy types and Move types.

- Create a variable with a Copy type (e.g., `i32`) and assign it to another variable.
- Create a variable with a Move type (e.g., `String`) and assign it to another variable.
- Show that the original Copy type variable can still be used, but the Move type variable cannot.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate the difference between Copy and Move semantics in Rust with code examples.
