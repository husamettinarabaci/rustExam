#### ❓ Question 1234: Handling asynchronous communication between services

Explain how you would implement asynchronous communication between Rust microservices.

- Describe the benefits of async communication (e.g., decoupling, scalability).
- List common patterns (message queues, event buses, pub/sub).
- Suggest Rust crates for async messaging (e.g., `lapin` for RabbitMQ, `rdkafka` for Kafka).
- Provide a code snippet for sending or receiving messages asynchronously.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how Rust microservices can communicate asynchronously using message queues or event streams.
