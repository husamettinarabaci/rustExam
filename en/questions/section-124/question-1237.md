#### ❓ Question 1237: Securing microservices with mutual TLS

Write a Rust-based microservice example that demonstrates how to secure communication between services using mutual TLS (mTLS).

- Show how to configure a Rust web server (e.g., using `axum` or `hyper`) to require client certificates.
- Explain the certificate generation and validation process.
- Provide a minimal code example for both server and client setup.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a secure microservice communication channel using mutual TLS in Rust.
