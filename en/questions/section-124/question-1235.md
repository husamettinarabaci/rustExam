### 🔹 Category: Resilience Patterns
#### ❓ Question 1235: Resilience patterns: retries, circuit breakers

Describe how you would implement resilience patterns such as retries and circuit breakers in Rust microservices.

- Explain why resilience is important in distributed systems.
- List common patterns: retry, circuit breaker, fallback.
- Suggest Rust crates for implementing these patterns (e.g., `tower`, `futures-retry`).
- Provide a code example for retrying a failed request.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to add retry and circuit breaker logic to a Rust microservice for improved reliability.
