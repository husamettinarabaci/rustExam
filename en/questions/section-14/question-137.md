#### ❓ Question 137: Importing with `as`

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use the `as` keyword to rename imports:

- Create a module with a function.
- Import the function into `main` using `use ... as ...` to give it a new name.
- Call the function using its new name.
- Show what happens if you try to use the original name after renaming.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate how to use `as` to rename imports for clarity or to avoid name conflicts.
