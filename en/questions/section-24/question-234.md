#### ❓ Question 234: Consuming iterators with `collect` in Rust

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to consume an iterator using the `collect` method:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use `iter` and `map` to increment each element by 1.
- Use `collect` to gather the results into a new vector.
- Print the new vector.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `collect` to transform and gather elements from an iterator into a collection.
