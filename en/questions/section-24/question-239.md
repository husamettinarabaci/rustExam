#### ❓ Question 239: Using `any` and `all` with Iterators

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of the `any` and `all` methods on iterators:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use `any` to check if any element is negative.
- Use `all` to check if all elements are less than 100.
- Print the results to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Practice using iterator methods `any` and `all` to test conditions across collections.
