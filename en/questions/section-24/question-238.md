#### ❓ Question 238: Using `enumerate` and `zip` with Iterators

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of the `enumerate` and `zip` methods on iterators:

- Create two vectors of integers.
- Use `zip` to pair elements from both vectors.
- Use `enumerate` to iterate over the zipped pairs with their index.
- Print each index and the paired values to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Practice using iterator methods `enumerate` and `zip` to process multiple collections with indices.
