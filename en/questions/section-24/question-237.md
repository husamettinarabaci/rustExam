#### ❓ Question 237: Using `find` and `position` in Rust

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of the iterator methods `find` and `position`:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use `find` to locate the first element greater than a given value (e.g., 3).
- Use `position` to find the index of the first even number.
- Print both results.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `find` and `position` to search for elements and their indices in a collection.
