#### ❓ Question 235: Chaining iterator methods in Rust

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to chain multiple iterator methods:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use `iter`, `map`, and `filter` to process the elements (e.g., double each number, then keep only those greater than 5).
- Use `collect` to gather the results into a new vector.
- Print the resulting vector.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to chain several iterator methods to transform and filter a collection in Rust.
