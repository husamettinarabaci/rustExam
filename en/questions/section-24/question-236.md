#### ❓ Question 236: Using `fold` and `reduce` in Rust

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of the iterator methods `fold` and `reduce`:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use `fold` to calculate the sum of all elements.
- Use `reduce` to calculate the product of all elements (using `Iterator::reduce`).
- Print both results.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `fold` and `reduce` to aggregate values from a collection in Rust.
