#### ❓ Question 240: Using `peekable` and `cycle` with Iterators

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of the `peekable` and `cycle` methods on iterators:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use `peekable` to look ahead at the next element without advancing the iterator.
- Use `cycle` to repeat the elements of the vector.
- Print the first five elements from the cycled iterator.
- Print the next element using `peek` before consuming it.

🔧 **Task:** Practice using iterator methods `peekable` and `cycle` to look ahead and repeat elements in a collection.
