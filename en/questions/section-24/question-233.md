#### ❓ Question 233: Using `iter`, `map`, and `filter` in Rust

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of iterator methods `iter`, `map`, and `filter`:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use `iter` to iterate over the vector.
- Use `map` to square each element.
- Use `filter` to keep only even squares.
- Collect the results into a new vector and print it.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to chain iterator methods to process and filter a collection in Rust.
