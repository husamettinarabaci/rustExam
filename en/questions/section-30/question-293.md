#### ❓ Question 293: Managing visibility with `pub`, `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define multiple modules and create functions with different visibility levels (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, `pub(super)`).
- Demonstrate which functions are accessible from which scope.
- In the `main` function, call the accessible functions and add a comment for those that are not accessible.

🔧 **Task:** Show how function visibility is managed in modules using different visibility keywords.
