#### ❓ Question 292: Splitting code across multiple files and folders

Create a Rust project that does the following:

- In the main file (`main.rs`), declare a module (`mod`) and place the module code in a separate file (`module.rs`).
- Create a function inside the module and call it from the `main` function.
- Use the appropriate `mod` and `use` keywords to import the module and its function.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to split code into multiple files and use modules and imports in Rust.
