#### ❓ Question 978: Profiling async code and futures

To identify performance bottlenecks in a Rust async program:

- Use `tokio-console` or similar async profiling tools.
- Analyze which futures or tasks consume the most time.
- Report your findings.

🔧 **Task:** Profile which futures are slow in an async Rust application and provide a sample analysis.
