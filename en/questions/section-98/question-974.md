#### ❓ Question 974: Reducing size with LTO and binary stripping

To reduce the binary size of a Rust program:

- Enable LTO (Link Time Optimization) during compilation.
- Use the `strip` command to remove unnecessary symbols.
- Measure and compare the size difference.

🔧 **Task:** Use LTO and `strip` to minimize binary size and report the result.
