#### ❓ Question 216: Generic trait implementations

Write a Rust example that demonstrates implementing a trait generically for multiple types.

- Define a trait with at least one method.
- Implement this trait generically for all types that satisfy a certain bound (e.g., all types that implement another trait).
- Show how this allows different types to use the trait's method.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a trait generically for a range of types using trait bounds.
