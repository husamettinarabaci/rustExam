#### ❓ Question 219: Generic associated types

Define and use a trait with an associated type in Rust.

- Create a trait `Container` with an associated type `Item` and a method `contains` that takes a reference to `Item` and returns a `bool`.
- Implement this trait for a struct `NumberBox` that holds an `i32`.
- Demonstrate usage by checking if a `NumberBox` contains a specific value.

🔧 **Task:** Use associated types in a trait and implement it for a struct.
