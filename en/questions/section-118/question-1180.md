#### ❓ Question 1180: Performance testing lock-free algorithms

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a simple lock-free algorithm such as a counter or queue using atomic types.
- Measure the performance of the algorithm with different numbers of threads (e.g., use `std::time::Instant` for timing).
- Compare the results to observe the scalability of the lock-free algorithm.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example that measures and compares the performance of a lock-free algorithm with multiple threads.
