#### ❓ Question 1179: Debugging lock-free code

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a simple lock-free data structure using `std::sync::atomic` or similar atomic types.
- Intentionally introduce a race condition or bug (e.g., a non-atomic update).
- Use `println!`, `debug_assert!`, or similar tools to observe the race condition during debugging.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example that demonstrates debugging techniques and observing race conditions in lock-free code.
