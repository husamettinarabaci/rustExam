#### ❓ Question 1322: Compile-time guarantees with typestates

Do the following:

- Create an example using typestates to ensure an API can only be called in a certain state.
- Design a structure that prevents incorrect usage at compile time.

🔧 **Task:** Write a Rust example where only the correct methods can be called on an object in the right "state" using typestates.
