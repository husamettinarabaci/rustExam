#### ❓ Question 1360: Auditing plugin code for vulnerabilities

In a Rust application, implement a process to audit loaded plugin code for vulnerabilities:

- Scan plugin code with static analysis tools (e.g., `cargo-audit`, `clippy`).
- Block loading if known vulnerabilities or dangerous patterns are detected.
- Report audit results to the main application.
- Integrate the audit process into the plugin loading workflow.

🔧 **Task:** Suggest a sample Rust code or process for auditing plugin code for vulnerabilities.
