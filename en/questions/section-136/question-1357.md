#### ❓ Question 1357: Cryptographic verification of plugins

In a Rust application, add cryptographic verification to ensure the integrity and security of loaded plugins:

- Verify digital signatures or hash values of plugin files.
- Allow only verified plugins to be loaded.
- If verification fails, prevent loading and notify the user.
- Use an appropriate Rust crate (e.g., `ring`, `sha2`) for cryptographic verification.

🔧 **Task:** Suggest a sample Rust code or structure for plugin verification.
