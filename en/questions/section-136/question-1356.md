#### ❓ Question 1356: Monitoring plugin behavior and resource usage

In a Rust application, implement a mechanism to monitor the behavior and resource usage of plugins:

- Add a tracking system to the plugin API that monitors each plugin's operations and resource consumption.
- Record metrics such as CPU time, memory usage, or file access per plugin.
- Report monitoring results to the main application.
- Optionally, add a control mechanism to limit a plugin's resource usage if necessary.

🔧 **Task:** Suggest a sample Rust code or structure for monitoring plugin behavior and resource usage.
