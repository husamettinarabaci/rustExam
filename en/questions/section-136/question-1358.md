#### ❓ Question 1358: Preventing code injection attacks in plugins

In a Rust application, implement measures to prevent code injection attacks in the plugin system:

- Allow only trusted and signed sources when loading plugins.
- Restrict the plugin API to block dangerous operations (e.g., filesystem, network access).
- Consider running plugin code in a separate process or secure environment.
- Enforce type safety and boundary checks in the plugin interface.

🔧 **Task:** Suggest a sample Rust code or structure to prevent code injection.
