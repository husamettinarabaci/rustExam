#### ❓ Question 1359: Secure plugin update and rollback mechanisms

In a Rust application, design a secure update and rollback mechanism for plugins:

- Apply plugin updates atomically and verifiably.
- If an update fails, automatically roll back to the previous version.
- Manage plugin versions and backups securely.
- Perform integrity and security checks during rollback.

🔧 **Task:** Suggest a sample Rust code or structure for plugin update and rollback.
