#### ❓ Question 740: Exploring how vtables are generated and optimized by the compiler

Explain how Rust's compiler generates vtables for trait objects and what optimizations it may perform. Provide a code example and discuss how to inspect or reason about the vtable layout.

- Write a trait and a struct implementing it.
- Use a trait object in code.
- Discuss how to view vtable-related information (e.g., using `cargo rustc -- --emit=llvm-ir` or `cargo asm`).

🔧 **Task:** Describe and demonstrate how Rust handles vtable generation and optimization for trait objects.
