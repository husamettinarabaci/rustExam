#### ❓ Question 737: Implementing custom vtable-based polymorphism manually

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to manually implement vtable-based polymorphism (without using `dyn Trait`).

- Define a struct representing a vtable of function pointers.
- Create a data struct and a vtable instance.
- Show how to call methods via the vtable.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate how to achieve manual dynamic dispatch in Rust using custom vtables.
