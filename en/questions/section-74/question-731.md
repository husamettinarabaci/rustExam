#### ❓ Question 731: Creating and using trait objects with `&dyn Trait` and `Box<dyn Trait>`

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Define a trait and implement it for at least two different types.
- Create trait objects using both `&dyn Trait` and `Box<dyn Trait>`.
- Call trait methods through these trait objects and print the results.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use trait objects for dynamic dispatch with both references and heap allocation.
