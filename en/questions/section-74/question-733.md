#### ❓ Question 733: Implementing and calling methods through trait objects

Write a Rust program that:

- Defines a trait with at least one method.
- Implements the trait for two or more types.
- Stores trait objects in a collection (e.g., `Vec<Box<dyn Trait>>`).
- Iterates over the collection and calls the trait method on each object, printing the result.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use trait objects to call methods dynamically on different types.
