#### ❓ Question 736: Measuring and comparing dynamic dispatch overhead

Write a Rust example that compares the performance of calling a method through a trait object (`dyn Trait`) versus calling it directly on a concrete type.

- Define a trait and a struct implementing it.
- Benchmark method calls using both a trait object and a concrete type (use a loop for timing).
- Print or comment on the observed difference.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to measure and compare the overhead of dynamic dispatch in Rust.
