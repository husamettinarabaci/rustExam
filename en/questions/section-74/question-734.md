#### ❓ Question 734: Using `dyn Trait` with multiple trait bounds

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use a trait object (`dyn Trait`) with multiple trait bounds.

- Define two traits and a struct that implements both.
- Create a function that accepts a trait object with multiple trait bounds (e.g., `dyn TraitA + TraitB`).
- Show how to use this function with your struct.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to work with trait objects that require multiple trait bounds in Rust.
