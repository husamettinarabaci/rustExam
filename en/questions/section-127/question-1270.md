#### ❓ Question 1270: Optimizing DSL execution performance

Write a Rust example that demonstrates techniques for optimizing the execution performance of a simple arithmetic DSL.

- Discuss or implement strategies such as AST simplification (constant folding), avoiding unnecessary allocations, or using efficient data structures.
- Show a function that performs constant folding on an AST before evaluation.
- Demonstrate the performance benefit with a simple example.

🔧 **Task:** Apply and explain at least one optimization technique for a Rust-based arithmetic DSL.
