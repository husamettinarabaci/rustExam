#### ❓ Question 1266: Generating Rust code from DSL constructs

Write a Rust procedural macro that takes a simple DSL as input and generates equivalent Rust code.

- Define a custom DSL syntax for arithmetic expressions.
- Implement a procedural macro that parses the DSL and outputs Rust code using `quote!`.
- Show how the macro can be used to generate and execute code in a function.

🔧 **Task:** Use a procedural macro to convert a DSL expression into Rust code at compile time.
