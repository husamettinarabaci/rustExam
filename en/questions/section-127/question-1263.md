#### ❓ Question 1263: Building ASTs for embedded DSLs

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a simple embedded DSL.

- Define Rust structs and enums to represent arithmetic expressions (e.g., literals, addition, multiplication).
- Implement a function to evaluate the AST.
- Show how to construct and evaluate an expression like `1 + 2 * 3` using your AST.

🔧 **Task:** Model a simple arithmetic DSL as an AST in Rust and provide an evaluation function.
