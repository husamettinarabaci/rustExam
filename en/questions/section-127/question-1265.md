#### ❓ Question 1265: Extending DSLs with variables and scopes

Write a Rust example that extends a simple arithmetic DSL to support variables and lexical scopes.

- Modify your AST to include variable identifiers.
- Implement an environment (e.g., a `HashMap`) to store variable bindings.
- Update the evaluation function to handle variables and scopes.
- Demonstrate with an example where variables are used in expressions.

🔧 **Task:** Extend your arithmetic DSL to support variables and lexical scoping.
