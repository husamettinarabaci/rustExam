#### ❓ Question 1264: Evaluating expressions with pattern matching

Write a Rust function that evaluates arithmetic expressions represented as an AST using pattern matching.

- Use an enum to represent literals, addition, and multiplication.
- Implement a recursive function that uses `match` to evaluate the expression.
- Demonstrate the function with an example expression.

🔧 **Task:** Use pattern matching to recursively evaluate an arithmetic expression AST.
