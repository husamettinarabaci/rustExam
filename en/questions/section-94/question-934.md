#### ❓ Question 934: Service discovery and load balancing

Describe how service discovery and load balancing are handled in distributed systems using Rust:

- Explain what service discovery is and why it is necessary in microservice architectures.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how a Rust application might register itself with a service registry (e.g., Consul, etcd) and discover other services.
- Briefly discuss load balancing strategies and how they can be implemented or integrated in Rust-based systems.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate the basics of service discovery and load balancing in Rust, including registration and lookup steps.
