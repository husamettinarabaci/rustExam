#### ❓ Question 937: Building fault-tolerant systems

Explain how to build fault-tolerant distributed systems in Rust:

- Define fault tolerance and its importance in distributed architectures.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how Rust features (such as `Result`, retries, circuit breakers, or supervisor patterns) can be used to handle failures.
- Discuss strategies for detecting, isolating, and recovering from failures in Rust-based distributed systems.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate techniques for achieving fault tolerance in Rust microservices, including error handling and recovery patterns.
