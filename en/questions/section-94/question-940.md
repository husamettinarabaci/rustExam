#### ❓ Question 940: Cloud-native Rust application design

Describe the principles and best practices for designing cloud-native applications in Rust:

- Define what makes an application "cloud-native" and why these principles matter.
- List key architectural patterns (e.g., statelessness, configuration via environment, health checks, graceful shutdown).
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how to implement at least one cloud-native pattern (such as reading configuration from environment variables or handling graceful shutdown) in Rust.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to apply cloud-native design principles in a Rust microservice.
