#### ❓ Question 936: Observability: metrics, tracing, and logging

Describe how observability is achieved in distributed Rust systems using metrics, tracing, and logging:

- Explain the importance of observability in distributed systems.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how to instrument a Rust application for metrics (e.g., with `metrics` crate), tracing (e.g., with `tracing` crate), and logging (e.g., with `log` or `env_logger`).
- Discuss best practices for collecting and exporting observability data in Rust microservices.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to add metrics, tracing, and logging to a Rust microservice for better observability.
