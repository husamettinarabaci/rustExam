#### ❓ Question 938: Implementing distributed caching

Describe how distributed caching can be implemented in Rust-based systems:

- Explain what distributed caching is and why it is useful in microservices and cloud architectures.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how a Rust application might interact with a distributed cache (e.g., Redis or Memcached) for storing and retrieving data.
- Discuss consistency, invalidation, and failure handling strategies for distributed caches in Rust.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use a distributed cache in Rust, including basic get/set operations and cache invalidation considerations.
