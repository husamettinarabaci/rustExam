#### ❓ Question 933: Distributed consensus algorithms (Raft, Paxos)

Write a Rust program or explanation that demonstrates the basics of distributed consensus algorithms such as Raft or Paxos:

- Briefly explain what distributed consensus is and why it is important in distributed systems.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how a simple consensus step (e.g., leader election or log replication) could be modeled in Rust.
- Discuss the challenges of implementing consensus in real-world distributed systems.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate the core idea of distributed consensus (Raft or Paxos) in Rust, focusing on a key step such as leader election or log replication.
