#### ❓ Question 939: Secure communication in distributed environments

Explain how to achieve secure communication between services in distributed Rust systems:

- Describe the importance of secure communication (encryption, authentication) in cloud and distributed architectures.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how to use TLS (e.g., with `rustls` or `native-tls`) to secure connections between Rust services.
- Discuss best practices for certificate management, mutual TLS, and protecting sensitive data in transit.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to implement encrypted and authenticated communication between Rust microservices.
