#### ❓ Question 935: Asynchronous message queues

Explain the role of asynchronous message queues in distributed systems and how to use them in Rust:

- Describe what an asynchronous message queue is and why it is important for microservices and distributed architectures.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how to send and receive messages using a message queue in Rust (e.g., with `lapin` for RabbitMQ or `rdkafka` for Kafka).
- Discuss the benefits and challenges of using message queues in Rust-based systems.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate basic usage of an asynchronous message queue in Rust, including sending and receiving messages.
