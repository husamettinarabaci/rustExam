#### ❓ Question 278: Combining smart pointers in nested structures

Follow these steps to use multiple smart pointers together in a Rust data structure:

- Define a nested data structure (such as a tree or graph).
- Use different smart pointers like `Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`, or `RefCell` for different fields as appropriate.
- Explain the ownership, sharing, and interior mutability requirements.
- Demonstrate at least two different smart pointer types used together in your code.

🔧 **Task:** Create a Rust data model for a nested structure that combines multiple smart pointers to satisfy ownership and sharing requirements.
