#### ❓ Question 273: Using `Rc<RefCell<T>>` in a single-threaded tree structure

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a tree structure (e.g., a binary tree).
- Use `Rc<RefCell<T>>` to link nodes together.
- Manage references so that nodes can have both parent and child relationships.
- Demonstrate an example of inserting or traversing the tree.

🔧 **Task:** Create an example tree structure using `Rc<RefCell<T>>` to enable shared ownership and interior mutability between nodes in a single-threaded context.
