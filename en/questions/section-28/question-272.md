#### ❓ Question 272: Creating interior mutability with `RefCell<T>`

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Use `RefCell<T>` in a struct field to allow mutation at runtime instead of compile time.
- Define a struct that wraps a vector and provides a method to update its elements.
- Show how to use `borrow_mut()` and `borrow()` methods.

🔧 **Task:** Write code that exemplifies interior mutability with `RefCell<T>` and demonstrates runtime borrow rules in action.
