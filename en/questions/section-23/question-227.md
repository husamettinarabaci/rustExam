#### ❓ Question 227: Implementing a generic method with lifetime parameters

Write a Rust method that demonstrates the use of both generic type parameters and explicit lifetime parameters.

- Define a struct `Pair` that holds two values of type `T`.
- Implement a method `longest_ref` that takes references to two string slices with the same lifetime and returns the longer one.
- The method should be generic over the lifetime parameter.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a method for a struct that uses both generic type and lifetime parameters in its signature.
