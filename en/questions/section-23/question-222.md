#### ❓ Question 222: Generic trait bounds

Write a Rust function that uses generic trait bounds.

- Define a function `sum_and_display` that takes two parameters of a generic type `T`.
- Constrain `T` to types that implement both `Add<Output = T>` and `Display`.
- The function should print the sum of the two values.
- Demonstrate usage with integers and floating-point numbers.

🔧 **Task:** Use trait bounds to restrict generic types in a function definition.
