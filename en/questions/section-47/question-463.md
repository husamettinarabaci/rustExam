#### ❓ Question 463: Sharing code across crates with `path` dependencies

Create a workspace example that does the following:

- Make one crate use another crate as a `path` dependency.
- Define the `path` dependency in the `Cargo.toml` file.
- Call a shared function from the dependent crate.

🔧 **Task:** Set up a workspace where one crate depends on another via `path` and demonstrate function sharing.
