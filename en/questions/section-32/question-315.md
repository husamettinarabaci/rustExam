#### ❓ Question 315: Default method implementations in traits

Write a Rust program that demonstrates default method implementations in traits:

- Define a trait `Speak` with a default implementation for the `speak` method.
- Define a struct `Dog` and implement the `Speak` trait for it, but do not override the default method.
- Define a struct `Cat` and implement the `Speak` trait for it, this time overriding the default method with your own implementation.
- In `main`, create a `Dog` and a `Cat`, and call the `speak` method for both.

🔧 **Task:** Show how default method implementations work in traits and how to override them for specific structs.
