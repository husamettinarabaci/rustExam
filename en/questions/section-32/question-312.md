#### ❓ Question 312: Adding trait bounds to generic functions

Do the following:

- Define a trait named `Speak` with a `speak` method.
- Write a generic function that accepts any type implementing the `Speak` trait.
- The function should call the `speak` method on its parameter.
- Create a struct named `Dog` and implement the `Speak` trait for it.
- Pass a `Dog` instance to the generic function and print `Woof woof!`.

🔧 **Task:** Write a generic function with a trait bound and use it with a struct that implements the trait.
