#### ❓ Question 320: What are trait coherence and the orphan rule?

Do the following:

- Explain the concepts of trait coherence and the orphan rule in Rust.
- Describe why the orphan rule exists and show an example where the compiler rejects a trait implementation.
- Implement your own trait for your own type (allowed scenario).
- Attempt to implement an external trait for an external type (not allowed, show compiler error example).

🔧 **Task:** Write Rust code and explanations demonstrating trait coherence and the orphan rule.
