#### ❓ Question 318: Creating trait hierarchies with supertraits

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a trait named `Speak` with a method `speak`.
- Define a trait named `Animal` that is a supertrait of `Speak`.
- Create a struct named `Dog` and implement both `Speak` and `Animal` for it.
- In the `main` function, create a `Dog` instance and call both the `speak` and `describe` methods.

🔧 **Task:** Use supertraits to create a trait hierarchy and implement multiple traits for a struct.
