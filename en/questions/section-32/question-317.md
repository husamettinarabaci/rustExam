#### ❓ Question 317: Using `impl Trait` in function return types

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a trait named `Speak` with a `speak` method.
- Create a struct `Dog` and implement the `Speak` trait for it.
- Write a function that returns `impl Speak` and returns a `Dog` instance.
- In `main`, call this function and use the returned object's `speak` method to print output to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Create an example that returns a trait object using `impl Trait` in the function return type.
