#### ❓ Question 314: Using `where` clauses for trait bounds

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of `where` clauses for multiple trait bounds in a generic function:

- Define two traits, `Speak` and `Run`, each with a method (`speak` and `run`).
- Implement both traits for a struct called `Dog`.
- Write a generic function that takes a parameter constrained by both `Speak` and `Run` traits, using a `where` clause in the function signature.
- In `main`, create a `Dog` and call the generic function with it.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use a `where` clause for multiple trait bounds in a generic function and implement them for a struct.
