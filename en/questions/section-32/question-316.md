#### ❓ Question 316: Implementing a trait for an external type

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a new trait (`Shout`) for the standard library type `String`.
- The `Shout` trait should have a `shout` method that converts the string to uppercase and adds an exclamation mark.
- Implement this trait for the `String` type.
- Create a `String` and call the `shout` method, printing the result to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Implement your own trait for an external type (e.g., `String`) and use it.
