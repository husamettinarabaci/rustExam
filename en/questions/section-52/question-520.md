#### ❓ Question 520: Ensuring memory safety without heap allocation

Explain how Rust ensures memory safety in embedded systems without using a heap:

- Discuss stack allocation, ownership, and borrowing.
- Describe how the type system prevents common memory errors.
- Mention the benefits of avoiding dynamic memory allocation in embedded.

🔧 **Task:** Describe Rust's memory safety guarantees in heapless embedded environments.
