#### ❓ Question 518: Using `heapless` collections in embedded contexts

Write an embedded Rust example that:

- Uses a `heapless` collection (e.g., `heapless::Vec` or `heapless::spsc::Queue`).
- Demonstrates storing and retrieving data without dynamic memory allocation.

🔧 **Task:** Use a `heapless` collection to store and access data in an embedded Rust program.
