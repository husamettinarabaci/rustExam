#### ❓ Question 513: Blinking an LED on a microcontroller using GPIO

Write an embedded Rust program that blinks an LED:

- Configure a GPIO pin as output for an LED.
- Toggle the pin in a loop to blink the LED with a delay.
- Use a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) crate if needed.

🔧 **Task:** Blink an LED by toggling a GPIO pin in an embedded Rust program.
