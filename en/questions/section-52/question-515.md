#### ❓ Question 515: Working with memory-mapped registers safely

Write an embedded Rust example that:

- Accesses a memory-mapped register (e.g., a peripheral control register).
- Uses safe abstractions (e.g., a HAL or PAC crate) to avoid unsafe code where possible.
- Demonstrates reading or writing to the register.

🔧 **Task:** Safely access and modify a memory-mapped register in embedded Rust.
