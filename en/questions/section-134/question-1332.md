#### ❓ Question 1332: State management with reactive paradigms

Write a Rust WASM UI example that demonstrates state management using a reactive paradigm (such as signals or state hooks).

- Use a framework like Leptos or Yew.
- Create a component that manages its own state reactively.
- Show how the UI updates automatically when the state changes.

🔧 **Task:** Build a simple counter or toggle component that updates the UI in response to state changes using a reactive approach.
