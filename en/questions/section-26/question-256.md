#### ❓ Question 256: Borrowing parts of a composite struct safely

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a struct with multiple fields (for example, `Rectangle`).
- Write a function that borrows two different fields of this struct at the same time.
- Return references to both fields from the function, following Rust's borrowing rules.
- Test the function with a sample struct and print both fields using the returned references.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to safely borrow two different fields of a struct at the same time without violating Rust's borrowing rules.
