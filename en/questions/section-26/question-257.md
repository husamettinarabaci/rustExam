#### ❓ Question 257: Using pattern matching to destructure and move out fields

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a struct with multiple fields.
- In a function, use pattern matching to destructure the struct and move out ownership of some fields.
- Continue using the remaining fields or assign them to another variable.
- Pay attention to ownership rules and avoid compiler errors.

🔧 **Task:** Use correct Rust syntax to move out fields from a struct using pattern matching and handle ownership properly.
