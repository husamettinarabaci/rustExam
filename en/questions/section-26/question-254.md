#### ❓ Question 254: Modeling ownership transfer in domain logic

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Define a domain scenario (such as a library, bank, or inventory system) where ownership of an item or resource is transferred between entities (e.g., from one struct to another).
- Implement structs and functions to model the transfer of ownership in the domain logic.
- Show how Rust's ownership system enforces safe transfer and prevents use-after-move errors.
- Print out the state before and after the transfer to verify correct behavior.

🔧 **Task:** Model a real-world scenario where ownership transfer is part of the domain logic, and explain how Rust's ownership system ensures correctness and safety.
