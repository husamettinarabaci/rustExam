#### ❓ Question 255: Creating helper functions that preserve ownership semantics

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Define one or more helper functions that safely manage ownership transfer or borrowing.
- Use these functions to transfer ownership or borrow a reference to a value.
- Show how Rust's ownership and borrowing rules are preserved through these functions.
- Print out values to verify the effect and usage of the functions.

🔧 **Task:** Design helper functions that preserve ownership semantics and explain how Rust's ownership/borrowing system ensures safety.
