#### ❓ Question 253: Moving ownership across multiple layers of abstraction

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Define multiple structs and/or functions that represent different abstraction layers (e.g., data, service, application).
- Move ownership of a value (such as a struct or primitive) from one layer to another through function calls or struct fields.
- Show how Rust enforces ownership transfer and prevents use-after-move errors.
- Print out values at each layer to verify correct ownership transfer.

🔧 **Task:** Model a scenario where ownership is moved across several abstraction layers, and explain how Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety.
