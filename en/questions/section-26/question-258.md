#### ❓ Question 258: Working with lifetime annotations in deeply nested functions

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define multiple nested functions that use references.
- Specify lifetime annotations correctly in the function signatures.
- Safely manage the lifetimes of references across deeply nested functions.
- Avoid lifetime-related compiler errors.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example that demonstrates correct use of lifetime annotations in deeply nested functions to ensure reference safety.
