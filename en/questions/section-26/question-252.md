#### ❓ Question 252: Combining `Box`, `Rc`, and `RefCell` in a single data model

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Define a data structure (such as a tree node or custom struct) that uses `Box`, `Rc`, and `RefCell` together.
- Show how to use `Box` for heap allocation, `Rc` for shared ownership, and `RefCell` for interior mutability.
- Create and manipulate instances of this structure, demonstrating shared, mutable access.
- Print out the structure or its values to verify correct usage.

🔧 **Task:** Model a scenario where `Box`, `Rc`, and `RefCell` are combined in a single data model, and explain how each smart pointer contributes to ownership and mutability.
