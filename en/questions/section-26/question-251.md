#### ❓ Question 251: Building nested structs with owned and borrowed fields

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the following:

- Define two or more structs, where at least one struct contains both owned and borrowed fields (using references).
- Properly annotate lifetimes for borrowed fields.
- Create instances of these structs, showing how ownership and borrowing work together in nested data structures.
- Print out the values to verify correct construction and borrowing.

🔧 **Task:** Model a scenario with nested structs that combine owned and borrowed fields, and explain how Rust's ownership and lifetime system ensures safety.
