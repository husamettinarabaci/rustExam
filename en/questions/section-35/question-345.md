#### ❓ Question 345: Writing integration tests in the `tests/` directory

Create integration tests in a Rust project:

- Create a `tests/` directory at the project root.
- Add a new `.rs` file in this directory (e.g., `integration_test.rs`).
- Test a function from your main library crate in this file.
- Mark the test function with `#[test]` and use an assertion (e.g., `assert_eq!`).

🔧 **Task:** Create an integration test file in the `tests/` directory and test a function from your main library crate.
