#### ❓ Question 342: Validation with assert_eq!, assert_ne!, and assert! macros

Follow these steps to use assertion macros in unit tests:

- Define a function (for example, a function that sums two numbers).
- Create a unit test module for this function.
- Write at least three different tests using `assert_eq!`, `assert_ne!`, and `assert!` macros.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use assertion macros in Rust unit tests for validation.
