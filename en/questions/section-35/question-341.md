#### ❓ Question 341: Writing unit tests with `#[test]`

Write a Rust program and test module that does the following:

- Define a simple function (e.g., addition).
- Use the `#[test]` attribute to write unit tests for this function.
- In the test function, use `assert_eq!` to verify the expected result.

🔧 **Task:** Write a unit test function in Rust to test the correctness of another function.
