#### ❓ Question 344: Running tests with `cargo test` and filtering by name

In a Rust project, to run your tests and filter them by name, do the following:

- Write the command to run all tests.
- Show how to run only a specific test function by filtering by name.
- Observe which tests passed or failed in the output.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `cargo test` command and test name filtering to run tests and review the results.
