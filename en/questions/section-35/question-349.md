#### ❓ Question 349: Inspecting code with cargo expand or cargo asm

Which tools can you use in Rust to inspect your compiled code or macro expansions?

- Use the `cargo expand` command to view macro expansions and generated code.
- Use the `cargo asm` command to inspect the compiled assembly output of functions.
- Try both tools on a simple function and observe their outputs.

🔧 **Task:** Run both `cargo expand` and `cargo asm` on a simple function and explain what their outputs show.
