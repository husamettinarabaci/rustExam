#### ❓ Question 348: Debugging with dbg! and println!

How do you use the `dbg!` and `println!` macros for debugging in Rust?

- Use the `dbg!` macro to print the value of a variable or expression to the terminal, along with file and line information.
- Use the `println!` macro to print custom messages or variable values at specific points in your program.
- Observe the difference in output between `dbg!` and `println!`.

🔧 **Task:** Write a short example that prints a variable's value using both `dbg!` and `println!`, and compare their outputs.
