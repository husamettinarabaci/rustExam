#### ❓ Question 346: Testing failure conditions with `#[should_panic]`

Write a Rust test function that expects a panic:

- Ensure a function panics under certain conditions.
- Mark the test function with the `#[should_panic]` attribute.
- Write code in the test that will cause a panic (e.g., accessing a vector out of bounds).

🔧 **Task:** Write a test function using `#[should_panic]` to verify that a function panics as expected.
