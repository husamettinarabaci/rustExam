#### ❓ Question 350: Understanding test isolation and side effects

What is test isolation in Rust and why is it important?

- Explain that each test function should run independently and not be affected by other tests.
- Describe how side effects (e.g., file system changes, global variables) can impact test results.
- Give examples of how to ensure test isolation in practice.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example of a test with side effects and an isolated test, and explain the difference.
