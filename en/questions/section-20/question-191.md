#### ❓ Question 191: Using `expect` and `unwrap` safely

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use `expect` and `unwrap` safely on `Option` and `Result` types.

- Create examples where `unwrap` and `expect` are used on `Option` and `Result` values.
- Show how to avoid panics by ensuring the value is `Some`/`Ok` before calling them.
- Explain when it is appropriate to use `unwrap` or `expect`.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate safe usage of `unwrap` and `expect` and explain best practices for their use.
