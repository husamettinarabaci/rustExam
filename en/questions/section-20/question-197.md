#### ❓ Question 197: Error handling in libraries

Write a Rust library function that demonstrates idiomatic error handling.

- Create a function in a library (not in `main`) that performs an operation which can fail (e.g., parsing a string to a number, reading a file, etc.).
- Make sure the function returns a `Result` type with a suitable error type.
- Show how a user of the library would call this function and handle errors using pattern matching or the `?` operator.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate best practices for error handling in Rust libraries, including returning `Result` and documenting error cases.
