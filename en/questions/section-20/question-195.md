#### ❓ Question 195: Propagating errors

Write a Rust function that propagates errors from a called function using the `?` operator.

- Define a function that calls another function which returns a `Result`.
- Use the `?` operator to propagate any errors to the caller.
- Demonstrate how the error is handled in `main` using `match`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to propagate errors up the call stack using the `?` operator and handle them at the top level.
