#### ❓ Question 196: Handling errors in the main function

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to handle errors in the `main` function.

- Create a function that returns a `Result` type (for example, it could try to read a file or parse a number).
- In the `main` function, call this function and handle any errors gracefully.
- Print a success message if the operation succeeds, or print the error if it fails.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `Result` as the return type of `main` and handle errors using the `?` operator or pattern matching.
