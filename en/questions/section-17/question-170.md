#### ❓ Question 170: Matching on references and dereferencing in patterns

Write a Rust function that takes a reference to an integer as input and uses a `match` statement to:

- Print "Zero" if the value is 0.
- Print "Positive" if the value is greater than 0.
- Print "Negative" if the value is less than 0.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to match on references and use dereferencing in Rust pattern matching.
