#### ❓ Question 170: Matching on references and dereferencing in patterns

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to match on references and how to dereference values in pattern matching.

- Create a variable that holds a reference to an integer.
- Use a `match` statement to match on the reference and print the value.
- Show both matching directly on the reference and using dereferencing in the pattern.

🔧 **Task:** Practice matching on references and using dereferencing in Rust pattern matching.
