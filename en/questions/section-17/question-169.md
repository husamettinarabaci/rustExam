#### ❓ Question 169: Using multiple patterns with `|`

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use multiple patterns with the `|` operator in pattern matching:

- Use a `match` statement to match an integer value against several patterns using `|` (e.g., 1 | 3 | 5).
- Print a message if the value matches any of the specified patterns.
- Include a catch-all arm for values that do not match.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `|` operator in a `match` pattern to handle multiple values with a single arm and print the result.
