#### ❓ Question 161: Destructuring nested structs and enums

Write a Rust function that takes a nested struct and enum as input and demonstrates how to destructure them in a `match` statement.

- Define a struct that contains another struct and an enum as fields.
- Create an enum with at least two variants, one of which contains data.
- In your function, use a `match` statement to destructure both the struct and the enum, extracting all inner values.
- Print the extracted values.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to destructure nested structs and enums using pattern matching in Rust.
