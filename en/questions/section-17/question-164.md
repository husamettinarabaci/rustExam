#### ❓ Question 164: Ignoring values with `_` in patterns

Write a Rust function that takes a tuple of three integers and uses a `match` statement to:

- Print the first and third values, ignoring the second value using `_`.
- If the first value is 0, print "First is zero".
- Otherwise, print the first and third values.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `_` to ignore values in pattern matching with tuples in Rust.
