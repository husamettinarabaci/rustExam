#### ❓ Question 167: Matching on slices and arrays

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use pattern matching on slices and arrays:

- Create an array or slice of integers.
- Use a `match` statement to destructure the array or slice, matching on specific patterns (e.g., first element, last element, or length).
- Print different messages based on the matched pattern.

🔧 **Task:** Use pattern matching to destructure arrays or slices and print information based on their structure or contents.
