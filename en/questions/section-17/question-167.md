#### ❓ Question 167: Matching on slices and arrays

Write a Rust function that takes a slice of integers and uses a `match` statement to:

- Print "Empty" if the slice is empty.
- Print "Single element: <value>" if the slice has one element.
- Print "Starts with 1 and ends with 9" if the first element is 1 and the last is 9.
- Print "Other" for all other cases.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use pattern matching on slices and arrays in Rust.
