#### ❓ Question 165: Using `ref` and `ref mut` in patterns

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use `ref` and `ref mut` in pattern matching:

- Create a mutable variable holding a tuple or struct.
- Use a `match` statement to destructure and obtain references to fields using `ref` and `ref mut`.
- Mutate a value through a `ref mut` binding and print the result.

🔧 **Task:** Use `ref` and `ref mut` in pattern matching to borrow fields immutably and mutably, and show the effect of mutation.
