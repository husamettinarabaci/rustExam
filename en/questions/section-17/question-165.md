#### ❓ Question 165: Using `ref` and `ref mut` in patterns

Write a Rust function that takes a tuple of two integers and uses a `match` statement to:

- Use `ref` to create a reference to the first value if it is positive and print it.
- Use `ref mut` to create a mutable reference to the second value if it is negative and increment it by 1, then print it.
- Otherwise, print both values as they are.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use `ref` and `ref mut` in pattern matching with tuples in Rust.
