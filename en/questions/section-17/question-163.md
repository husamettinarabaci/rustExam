#### ❓ Question 163: Matching on ranges and bindings

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use pattern matching with ranges and variable bindings:

- Use a `match` statement to match an integer value against several ranges (e.g., 1..=5, 6..=10, etc.).
- Bind the matched value to a variable within the pattern and print it.
- Include a catch-all arm for values outside the specified ranges.

🔧 **Task:** Use `match` with range patterns and variable bindings to print which range the value falls into, including the matched value.
