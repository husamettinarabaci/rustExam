#### ❓ Question 163: Matching on ranges and bindings

Write a Rust function that takes an integer as input and uses a `match` statement to:

- Print "Low" if the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
- Print "Medium" if the number is between 11 and 100 (inclusive).
- Print "High" if the number is greater than 100.
- Print "Zero or negative" if the number is zero or negative.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use range patterns and variable bindings in Rust `match` arms.
