#### ❓ Question 166: Using `@` bindings in patterns

Write a Rust function that takes an integer as input and uses a `match` statement with `@` bindings to:

- Print "Teenager: <value>" if the value is between 13 and 19 (inclusive).
- Print "Child: <value>" if the value is between 0 and 12 (inclusive).
- Print "Adult: <value>" if the value is 20 or greater.
- Print "Negative age: <value>" if the value is negative.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use `@` bindings in Rust pattern matching to capture matched values.
