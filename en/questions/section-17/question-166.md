#### ❓ Question 166: Using `@` bindings in patterns

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use the `@` binding in pattern matching:

- Use a `match` statement to match an integer value against a range.
- Use the `@` syntax to bind the matched value to a variable within the pattern.
- Print the bound value and indicate which range it matched.

🔧 **Task:** Use the `@` binding in a `match` pattern to capture and print the matched value along with its range.
