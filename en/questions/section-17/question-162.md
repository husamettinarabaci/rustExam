#### ❓ Question 162: Using pattern guards in match arms

Write a Rust function that takes an integer as input and uses a `match` statement with pattern guards to:

- Print "Even and positive" if the number is even and positive.
- Print "Odd and positive" if the number is odd and positive.
- Print "Negative" if the number is negative.
- Print "Zero" if the number is zero.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate the use of pattern guards in Rust `match` arms to handle multiple conditions.
