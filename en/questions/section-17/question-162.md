#### ❓ Question 162: Using pattern guards in match arms

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use pattern guards in match arms.

- Define an enum with at least one variant containing a value (e.g., `Number(i32)`).
- Create an instance of the enum with a value.
- Use a `match` statement with pattern guards (e.g., `if` conditions) to handle different cases based on the value.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use pattern guards in match arms to add extra conditions to pattern matching.
