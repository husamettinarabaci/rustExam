#### ❓ Question 84: Struct update syntax

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the struct update syntax.

- Define a struct named `User` with fields `username` (String), `email` (String), and `active` (bool).
- Create an instance of `User` and assign values to its fields.
- Create a second `User` instance using the struct update syntax, changing only the `email` field.
- Print both users' information to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use the struct update syntax to create a new struct instance based on another in Rust.
