#### ❓ Question 680: Converting between different error types

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to convert between different error types:

- Define two or more custom error types.
- Implement `From` or `Into` traits to allow conversion between them.
- Show how error conversion simplifies error propagation in functions that can return multiple error types.

🔧 **Task:** Use error type conversion to simplify error handling in Rust applications.
