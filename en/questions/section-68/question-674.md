#### ❓ Question 674: Implementing retry logic for recoverable errors

Write a Rust function that implements retry logic for recoverable errors:

- Define a function that may fail and returns a `Result`.
- Implement a retry mechanism that attempts the operation up to a fixed number of times if it fails with a recoverable error.
- Use pattern matching to distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors.
- Print the result or error after all attempts.

🔧 **Task:** Implement retry logic for operations that may fail with recoverable errors.
