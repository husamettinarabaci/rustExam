#### ❓ Question 678: Error handling in async and multithreaded code

Write a Rust example that demonstrates error handling in async and multithreaded code:

- Write an async function that can fail and returns a `Result`.
- Show how to handle errors in async code using `.await` and pattern matching.
- Demonstrate error handling in a multithreaded context using `std::thread` and `JoinHandle`.

🔧 **Task:** Handle errors in both async and multithreaded Rust code.
