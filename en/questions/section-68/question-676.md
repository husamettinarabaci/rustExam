#### ❓ Question 676: Handling panics gracefully in applications

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to handle panics gracefully:

- Use `std::panic::catch_unwind` to catch panics in a controlled way.
- Show how to log or report the panic information instead of crashing the application.
- Optionally, demonstrate how to recover or clean up after a panic.

🔧 **Task:** Use panic catching to prevent application crashes and handle panics gracefully.
