#### ❓ Question 677: Logging and reporting errors in production

Write a Rust example that demonstrates best practices for logging and reporting errors in a production application:

- Use a logging crate (such as `log` and `env_logger`) to log errors.
- Show how to log different error levels (error, warn, info).
- Demonstrate how to report errors to an external system (e.g., by printing or simulating sending to a monitoring service).

🔧 **Task:** Integrate error logging and reporting into a Rust application.
