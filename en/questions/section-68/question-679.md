#### ❓ Question 679: Defining fallible constructors and builders

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to define fallible constructors and builders:

- Implement a struct with a constructor (`new`) that can fail and returns a `Result`.
- Use error types to indicate why construction failed.
- Show how to use the fallible constructor in practice.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a struct with a constructor that can fail and handle errors appropriately.
