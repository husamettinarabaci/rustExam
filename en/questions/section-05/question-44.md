#### ❓ Question 44: Using trait objects for polymorphism

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a trait named `Animal` with a method `speak(&self)`.
- Implement the trait for at least two different structs (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`).
- Write a function that takes a trait object (`&dyn Animal`) and calls `speak`.
- Demonstrate calling this function with different types.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use trait objects to enable polymorphism in Rust.
