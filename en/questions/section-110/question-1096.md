#### ❓ Question 1096: Proxy and gateway implementation

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Use Tokio or async-std to create a simple TCP proxy server.
- The proxy should forward data from the client to another server and relay the response back to the client.
- Data transfer between both client and server should be asynchronous.

🔧 **Task:** Write an async TCP proxy server application.
