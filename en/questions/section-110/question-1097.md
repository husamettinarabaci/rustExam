#### ❓ Question 1097: Async file IO and performance

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Use Tokio or async-std to asynchronously read a large file and write it to another file.
- Measure the performance of the read and write operations (e.g., print the elapsed time).
- Ensure all file operations are fully async.

🔧 **Task:** Write an async application that reads/writes files and measures performance.
