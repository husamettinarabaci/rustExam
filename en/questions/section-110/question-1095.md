#### ❓ Question 1095: Secure communication with Rustls

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Use `tokio-rustls` or a similar crate to create a TLS-enabled async TCP server and client.
- The server should read a message from the client and send a response.
- The client should securely send a message to the server and print the response.

🔧 **Task:** Write an async client and server with TLS support using Rustls.
