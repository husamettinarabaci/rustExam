#### ❓ Question 1099: Implementing custom protocols asynchronously

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Use async/await to handle a custom network protocol (e.g., a simple text-based protocol) asynchronously.
- The server should asynchronously read messages from incoming connections and respond.
- Use an async runtime such as Tokio or async-std.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a simple server in Rust that handles a custom protocol asynchronously.
