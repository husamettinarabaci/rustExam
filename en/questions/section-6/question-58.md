#### ❓ Question 58: Function with recursion

Write a Rust program that demonstrates a recursive function:

- Define a function that calls itself to compute the factorial of a number.
- Call this function from `main` and print the result for a sample input (e.g., 5).

🔧 **Task:** Show how to implement and use recursion in Rust functions.
