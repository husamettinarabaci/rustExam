Write a Rust program that demonstrates a function returning another function:

- Define a function that returns a function (or closure) which takes an integer and returns its square.
- Call the outer function from `main`, then use the returned function to compute and print the square of a number.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to return a function or closure from another function in Rust.
