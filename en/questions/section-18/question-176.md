#### ❓ Question 176: HashMap with custom types

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use a custom struct as a key or value in a `HashMap`.

- Define a simple struct (e.g., `Point { x: i32, y: i32 }`).
- Create a `HashMap` that uses the struct as a key or value.
- Implement the necessary traits (`Eq`, `PartialEq`, `Hash`) if using the struct as a key.
- Insert at least two entries and print the `HashMap`.

🔧 **Task:** Practice using custom types with `HashMap` in Rust.
