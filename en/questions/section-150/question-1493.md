#### ❓ Question 1493: Abstracting over unstable and experimental features

How can you design Rust code to abstract over unstable or experimental features, allowing for easier upgrades and fallback to stable alternatives?

- Describe techniques for isolating unstable code.
- Show how to use conditional compilation and feature flags.
- Explain how to provide stable fallbacks or shims.

🔧 **Task:** Outline a pattern for safely using unstable features while maintaining compatibility with stable Rust.
