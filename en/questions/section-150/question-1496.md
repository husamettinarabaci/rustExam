#### ❓ Question 1496: Designing extensible and modular crates

What are the key principles for designing Rust crates that are easy to extend and modularize for future needs?

- List best practices for modular crate architecture.
- Explain how to expose extensibility points (traits, modules, features).
- Discuss how to avoid tight coupling and promote reusability.

🔧 **Task:** Summarize guidelines for building Rust crates that can evolve and scale as requirements change.
