#### ❓ Question 1365: Minimizing runtime overhead in DSLs

In a Rust DSL implementation, minimize runtime overhead by:

- Resolving DSL expressions at compile time when possible.
- Avoiding unnecessary allocations and copies.
- Using constant data structures and functions for performance.

🔧 **Task:** Suggest a sample Rust code or technique for reducing runtime overhead in DSLs.
