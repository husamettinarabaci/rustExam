#### ❓ Question 1364: Generating efficient Rust code from DSL

In a Rust DSL implementation, generate efficient Rust code from DSL expressions by:

- Designing a compiler or code generator that analyzes and optimizes DSL expressions.
- Applying optimization techniques to improve the performance of the generated Rust code.
- Ensuring type safety and error checking in code generation.

🔧 **Task:** Describe a sample structure or process for generating efficient Rust code from DSL.
