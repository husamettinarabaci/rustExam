#### ❓ Question 1361: Inline expansion of DSL expressions

In a Rust DSL (domain-specific language) implementation, design a mechanism for inline expansion of DSL expressions:

- Define DSL expressions using a macro or function.
- Expand expressions inline at compile time or runtime.
- Explain the performance benefits of inline expansion.

🔧 **Task:** Suggest a sample Rust code or macro for inline expansion of DSL expressions.
