#### ❓ Question 1362: Optimizing recursive DSL functions

In a Rust DSL implementation, improve the performance of recursive functions by:

- Considering transforming recursive functions into iterative ones.
- Explaining tail-call optimization (TCO) or similar techniques.
- Describing the limitations and optimization strategies for recursion in Rust.

🔧 **Task:** Provide a sample Rust code or explanation for optimizing recursive DSL functions.
