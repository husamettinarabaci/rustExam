#### ❓ Question 890: Profiling and optimizing embedded real-time code

Follow these steps to profile and optimize real-time code in embedded Rust projects:

- Explain the importance of profiling real-time code and the tools used (e.g., semihosting, RTT, cycle counter).
- Use a sample technique or tool to identify code bottlenecks.
- Provide a simple example measuring a function's execution time and logging the result.

🔧 **Task:** Write sample code to measure a function's execution time using a cycle counter.
