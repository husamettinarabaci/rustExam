#### ❓ Question 886: Debugging concurrency bugs on embedded devices

Follow these steps to debug concurrency bugs in embedded Rust projects:

- Explain the symptoms and causes of concurrency bugs (race conditions, deadlocks, data inconsistency).
- List tools and techniques for debugging (e.g., semihosting, RTT, logging).
- Provide a simple example using logging or assert to detect a race condition.

🔧 **Task:** Write sample code using logging or assert to detect a race condition.
