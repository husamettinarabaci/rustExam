#### ❓ Question 881: Designing concurrency models for embedded Rust

Follow these steps to design concurrency models for embedded Rust projects:

- Research different concurrency models suitable for embedded systems (e.g., cooperative, preemptive, event-driven).
- Briefly explain the advantages and disadvantages of each model.
- Show, with a simple example, how one model can be implemented in Rust.

🔧 **Task:** Choose a concurrency model for embedded Rust and explain it with sample code.
