#### ❓ Question 1055: Recovering from panics in async contexts

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Simulate a panic in an async task.
- Use an appropriate method (e.g., `tokio::spawn` and `JoinHandle::await`) to catch and handle the panic.
- Prevent the program from crashing and print a suitable message after a panic.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to catch and handle panics in async tasks.
