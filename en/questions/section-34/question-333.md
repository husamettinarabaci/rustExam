#### ❓ Question 333: Using .iter(), .iter_mut(), and .into_iter() on collections

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a `Vec`, a `HashMap`, and a `HashSet`, and add some values to each.
- For each collection, use `.iter()`, `.iter_mut()`, and `.into_iter()` to iterate over the elements.
- During iteration, modify elements where possible and print them to the screen.

🔧 **Task:** Use different iterator methods on collections and observe their differences.
