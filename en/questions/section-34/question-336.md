#### ❓ Question 336: Iterating with `.enumerate()` and `zip()`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create and initialize a vector and a HashSet.
- Use `.enumerate()` to print each element of the vector along with its index.
- Use `.zip()` to iterate over both the vector and the HashSet at the same time, printing values from both collections together.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate indexed and simultaneous iteration over collections using the `.enumerate()` and `.zip()` iterator adaptors.
