#### ❓ Question 340: Error handling in iterators that return Result

Write a Rust program that demonstrates error handling in an iterator that returns `Result<T, E>`:

- Define a vector of integers.
- For each element, perform an operation (e.g., divide by 2) and return `Err` for invalid cases.
- Use an iterator to process the results, separating successful and error outcomes.
- Print both the successful values and the errors separately.

🔧 **Task:** Use an iterator that returns `Result` to separate and print both successful and error results.
