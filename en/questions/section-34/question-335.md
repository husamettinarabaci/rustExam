#### ❓ Question 335: Collecting iterator results into collections

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a vector of integers (for example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`).
- Use iterator adaptors like `iter`, `map`, and `filter` to select elements greater than 5 and multiply each by 3.
- Collect the results into both a vector (`Vec`) and a `HashSet`.
- Print both collections to the screen.

🔧 **Task:** Use iterator adaptors to transform data and collect the results into different collections, then print them.
