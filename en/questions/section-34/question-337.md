#### ❓ Question 337: Creating a custom iterator struct with `impl Iterator`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define your own custom iterator struct (for example, a counter that yields numbers from 1 to 5).
- Implement the `Iterator` trait for this struct using `impl`.
- Properly define the `next` method.
- Use this custom iterator to print all its values to the screen.

🔧 **Task:** Create and use a custom iterator struct by implementing `impl Iterator`.
