#### ❓ Question 334: Chaining iterator adaptors like `map`, `filter`, `take`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a `Vec<i32>` and add several numbers to it.
- Chain the following iterator adaptors on the vector:
  - Use `map` to multiply each element by two.
  - Use `filter` to select only even numbers.
  - Use `take` to get the first 3 results.
- Print the results to the screen.

🔧 **Task:** Transform and output data by chaining iterator adaptors.
