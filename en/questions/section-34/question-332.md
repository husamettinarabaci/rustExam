#### ❓ Question 332: Iterating over collections with `for` loops

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create and initialize a `Vec`, a `HashMap`, and a `HashSet`.
- Iterate over the elements of each collection using a `for` loop and print them to the terminal.
- Use the appropriate iteration method for each collection.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to iterate over different collection types with `for` loops and print their elements.
