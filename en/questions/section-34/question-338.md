#### ❓ Question 338: Finding, folding, and reducing values from iterators

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a vector of integers.
- Use the `find` method to search for a specific value and print the result.
- Use the `fold` method to calculate the sum of all elements and print it.
- Use the `reduce` method to find the maximum value in the vector and print it.

🔧 **Task:** Use iterator methods like `find`, `fold`, and `reduce` to perform search, sum, and max operations on a vector.
