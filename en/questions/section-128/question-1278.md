#### ❓ Question 1278: Using macros to enforce coding standards

Write a Rust macro that enforces a coding standard, such as requiring all struct fields to be `pub`.

- Implement a macro that checks struct field visibility.
- The macro should fail to compile if any field is not `pub`.
- Demonstrate usage with a struct definition.

🔧 **Task:** Create a macro that enforces all struct fields are public at compile time.
