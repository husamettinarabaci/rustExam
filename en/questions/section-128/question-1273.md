#### ❓ Question 1273: Building compile-time finite state machines

Write a Rust example that models a finite state machine (FSM) at compile time using types and traits.

- Define state types as empty structs.
- Implement state transitions as trait methods that consume one state and return another.
- Demonstrate a sequence of valid transitions in `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Model a finite state machine using types and traits to enforce transitions at compile time.
