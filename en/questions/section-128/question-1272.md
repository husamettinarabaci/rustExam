#### ❓ Question 1272: Type-level programming with `PhantomData`

Write a Rust example that demonstrates type-level programming using `PhantomData`.

- Define a generic struct that uses `PhantomData` to track a type parameter without storing a value of that type.
- Show how this can be used to enforce type relationships at compile time.
- Demonstrate usage in a function.

🔧 **Task:** Use `PhantomData` in a struct to encode type information at compile time.
