#### ❓ Question 1275: Static assertions and invariants

Write a Rust example that uses static assertions to enforce invariants at compile time.

- Use the `const_assert!` macro (from the `static_assertions` crate) or equivalent.
- Assert that the size of a struct is as expected.
- Show what happens if the assertion fails.

🔧 **Task:** Use static assertions to check a struct's size at compile time.
