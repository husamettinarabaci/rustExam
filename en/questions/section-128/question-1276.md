#### ❓ Question 1276: Leveraging specialization for compile-time defaults

Write a Rust example that demonstrates the use of specialization (nightly feature) to provide compile-time default implementations for a trait.

- Enable the `specialization` feature.
- Define a trait with a default method.
- Provide a specialized implementation for a specific type.
- Show how the specialized and default implementations are used.

🔧 **Task:** Use specialization to override a trait method for a specific type at compile time.
