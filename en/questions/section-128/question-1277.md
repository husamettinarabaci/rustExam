#### ❓ Question 1277: Generating code with build scripts (`build.rs`)

Write a Rust example that uses a `build.rs` build script to generate Rust code at compile time.

- Create a `build.rs` script that writes a Rust source file with a constant definition.
- Include the generated file in your main crate using `include!`.
- Print the constant in the `main` function.

🔧 **Task:** Use a build script to generate a Rust file and include it in your project.
