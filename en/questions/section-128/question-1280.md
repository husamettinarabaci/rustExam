#### ❓ Question 1280: Designing type-safe embedded DSLs

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to design a type-safe embedded DSL using traits and generics.

- Define traits for DSL operations (e.g., `Add`, `Mul`).
- Implement these traits for types representing DSL expressions.
- Show how the type system enforces correctness at compile time.

🔧 **Task:** Use traits and generics to build a type-safe embedded DSL in Rust.
