#### ❓ Question 1271: Using `const fn` for compile-time computations

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use `const fn` to perform computations at compile time.

- Define a `const fn` that calculates the factorial of a number.
- Use this function to compute a value at compile time and assign it to a `const` variable.
- Print the result in the `main` function.

🔧 **Task:** Use `const fn` to compute a factorial at compile time and display the result.
