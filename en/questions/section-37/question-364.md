#### ❓ Question 364: Using `use` to bring names into scope

Write a Rust code example that does the following:

- Define multiple modules, each with at least one function.
- Use the `use` keyword to bring these functions into scope so they can be called directly in the main function.
- Demonstrate how `use` works to simplify access to module items.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example showing how to use `use` to bring module functions directly into scope in Rust.
