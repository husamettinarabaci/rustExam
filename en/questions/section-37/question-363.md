#### ❓ Question 363: Organizing code with nested modules

Write a Rust code example that does the following:

- Define multiple nested modules (for example, a module inside another module).
- In each module, define at least one function or variable.
- In the main function, call or access these functions or variables from the nested modules to demonstrate access.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example that shows how to organize code using nested modules in Rust.
