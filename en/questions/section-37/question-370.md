#### ❓ Question 370: Creating a library-style crate structure

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to organize a project as a library-style crate:

- Use a `src/lib.rs` as the main entry point for the library.
- Define at least two modules (e.g., `math` and `utils`) in separate files.
- Show how to expose public functions from these modules.
- Illustrate how a user would use these functions after adding the crate as a dependency.

🔧 **Task:** Organize your Rust project as a library crate with multiple modules and public APIs.
