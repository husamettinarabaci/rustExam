#### ❓ Question 362: Using `pub`, `pub(crate)`, and private visibility

Follow these steps to explore module visibility in Rust:

- Create a Rust file with multiple modules.
- In each module, define a function and mark them with different visibility levels (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, and default/private).
- In the main function, attempt to access these functions and observe which ones are accessible.

🔧 **Task:** Create an example that demonstrates how different visibility specifiers (`pub`, `pub(crate)`, private) affect access between modules.
