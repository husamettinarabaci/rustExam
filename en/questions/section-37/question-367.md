#### ❓ Question 367: module entry file (mod.rs) usage

Create a Rust module structure that does the following:

- Define a module in a folder using multiple files.
- Use a `mod.rs` file in the folder as the main entry point for the module.
- In `mod.rs`, include submodules from other files (like `foo.rs`, `bar.rs`) and re-export a function.
- In the main file (`main.rs`), call the function re-exported by the module.

🔧 **Task:** Set up a multi-file module structure and manage the main module entry with `mod.rs`.
