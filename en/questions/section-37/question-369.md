#### ❓ Question 369: Avoiding circular dependencies with modular design

Write a Rust code example and explanation that does the following:

- Describe a scenario where two or more modules are directly dependent on each other, creating a circular dependency.
- Show why this circular dependency leads to a compiler error.
- Provide a correct modular design that achieves the same functionality without circular dependencies.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how circular dependencies occur and how to avoid them with proper modular design.
