#### ❓ Question 188: Using `map` and `and_then` on Option

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use the `map` and `and_then` methods on an `Option` value.

- Create an `Option<i32>` variable.
- Use `map` to transform the value if it exists (e.g., double it).
- Use `and_then` to chain another operation that returns an `Option` (e.g., only keep even results).

🔧 **Task:** Show how `map` and `and_then` can be used to process and chain computations on `Option` values.
