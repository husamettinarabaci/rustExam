#### ❓ Question 1118: Implementing async RAII patterns

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Implement the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern for an async resource (e.g., file or connection).
- Manage the resource with a struct, ensuring it is closed automatically when the struct is dropped.
- Demonstrate usage of this struct in async operations.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate the RAII pattern for async resources.
