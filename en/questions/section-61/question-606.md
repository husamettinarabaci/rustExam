#### ❓ Question 606: Creating C-compatible data structures with `#[repr(C)]`

To create C-compatible data structures in Rust:

- Explain the purpose of the `#[repr(C)]` attribute.
- Ensure Rust structs have the same memory layout as C structs.
- Show an example struct definition for sharing data with C.

🔧 **Task:** Define a C-compatible struct in Rust using `#[repr(C)]` and demonstrate sharing data with C code.
