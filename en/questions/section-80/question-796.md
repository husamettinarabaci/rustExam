#### ❓ Question 796: Using SIMD and explicit vectorization

Demonstrate how to use SIMD instructions and explicit vectorization in Rust.

- Show how to enable SIMD features.
- Provide a code example using `std::arch` or a crate like `packed_simd`.
- Explain the benefits and caveats of SIMD in systems programming.

🔧 **Task:** Write a Rust function that uses SIMD to accelerate a numeric computation.
