#### ❓ Question 1158: Combining sync and async code gracefully

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create an example with both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

- If necessary, use an appropriate method to safely run blocking code in an async context.

🔧 **Task:** Safely combine sync and async functions in a single example.
