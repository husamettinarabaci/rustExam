#### ❓ Question 1153: Composing complex async workflows

Write a Rust async function that chains together multiple async operations, handling errors at each step.

- Propagate or handle errors between steps.
- Return the final result or error.

🔧 **Task:** Compose a multi-step async workflow with error handling in Rust.
