#### ❓ Question 862: Building a minimal async runtime from scratch

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Build a minimal async runtime from scratch.
- Implement an executor that manually polls the `Future` trait.
- Run at least one async function by manually polling it.

🔧 **Task:** Without using any external crates, implement your own basic async executor and demonstrate running a sample async function.
