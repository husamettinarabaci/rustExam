#### ❓ Question 867: Coordination in multi-threaded executors

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Simulate a simple multi-threaded async executor.
- Assign and poll a future on each thread.
- Show output when each future completes.
- Do not use any external crates beyond the standard library.

🔧 **Task:** Write a simple multi-threaded executor example where each thread polls a future and prints output when it completes.
