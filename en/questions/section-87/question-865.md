#### ❓ Question 865: Timer and delay management in runtime

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Simulate a time delay using an async future.
- In your own executor, poll a future that waits for a certain duration.
- Do not use any external crates beyond the standard library.

🔧 **Task:** In your own async executor, poll a future that waits for a specific duration (e.g., 1 second) and print output when it completes.
