#### ❓ Question 863: Task scheduling and polling mechanisms

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Implement a simple executor that runs multiple async tasks (futures) in sequence.
- Manage the polling order and completion state of each task.
- Ensure each task produces output when completed.

🔧 **Task:** In your own executor, poll multiple async futures in sequence and show when each task is completed.
