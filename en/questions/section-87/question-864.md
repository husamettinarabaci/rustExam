#### ❓ Question 864: Implementing a custom Future and waker

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define your own custom Future type.
- Make this future complete in multiple steps when polled (e.g., a counter).
- Use the waker mechanism to simulate polling the future.

🔧 **Task:** Create a custom Future type that completes in several steps when polled, and demonstrate a simple waker in action.
