#### ❓ Question 627: Newtype pattern to implement external traits

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define a struct that wraps another type (newtype pattern).
- Implement an external trait (such as `Display` or `Debug`) for the newtype.
- Show how the newtype can be used where the trait is required.

🔧 **Task:** Use the newtype pattern to implement an external trait for a type you cannot implement directly.
