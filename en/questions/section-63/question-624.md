#### ❓ Question 624: Implementing trait objects with dynamic dispatch

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define a trait with at least one method.
- Implement the trait for a struct.
- Create a function that takes a trait object (`&dyn Trait` or `Box<dyn Trait>`) and calls the method.
- Show how dynamic dispatch works by passing different implementations.

🔧 **Task:** Use trait objects to enable dynamic dispatch and demonstrate calling trait methods through them.
