#### ❓ Question 622: Using default method implementations effectively

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define a trait with at least one default method implementation.
- Implement the trait for a struct, overriding the default method in one case and using the default in another.
- Show how both the default and overridden methods behave when called.

🔧 **Task:** Use default method implementations in a trait and demonstrate both overriding and using the default.
