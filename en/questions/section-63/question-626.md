#### ❓ Question 626: Conflict resolution in multiple trait impls

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define two traits with methods of the same name.
- Implement both traits for a struct.
- Show how to call each trait's method explicitly to resolve the conflict.

🔧 **Task:** Handle method name conflicts when implementing multiple traits for a struct and demonstrate explicit method calls.
