#### ❓ Question 629: Blanket implementations and coherence rules

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define a trait and provide a blanket implementation for all types that satisfy a certain bound.
- Show how the blanket implementation works for multiple types.
- Explain the coherence rules that allow or prevent certain blanket impls.

🔧 **Task:** Use blanket implementations to provide trait methods for a wide range of types and discuss coherence.
