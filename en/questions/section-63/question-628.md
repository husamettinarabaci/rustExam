#### ❓ Question 628: Using marker traits for compile-time guarantees

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define a marker trait (a trait with no methods).
- Implement the marker trait for one or more types.
- Write a function that only accepts types implementing the marker trait, enforcing a compile-time guarantee.

🔧 **Task:** Use marker traits to restrict function parameters and provide compile-time guarantees.
