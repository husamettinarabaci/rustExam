#### ❓ Question 625: Using specialization for default overrides (nightly)

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following (requires nightly Rust):

- Define a trait with a default method.
- Provide a specialized implementation for a specific type using the `default` keyword (nightly feature).
- Show how the specialized method overrides the default for that type.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate trait specialization and default overrides using nightly Rust features.
