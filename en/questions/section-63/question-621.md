#### ❓ Question 621: Creating trait hierarchies and supertraits

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define at least two traits, where one trait is a supertrait of the other.
- Implement both traits for a struct.
- Show how a function can accept a parameter that requires the subtrait (and thus also the supertrait).

🔧 **Task:** Build a trait hierarchy using supertraits and implement them for a struct, then use them in a function signature.
