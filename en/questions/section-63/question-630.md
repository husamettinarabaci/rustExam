#### ❓ Question 630: Combining traits with `where` clauses for readability

Write Rust code that demonstrates the following:

- Define a function or trait that uses a `where` clause to combine multiple trait bounds.
- Show how the `where` clause improves readability compared to inline bounds.
- Provide an example with at least two trait bounds.

🔧 **Task:** Use `where` clauses to combine trait bounds in a readable way in function or trait definitions.
