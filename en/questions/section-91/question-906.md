#### ❓ Question 906: Cross-platform SIMD abstractions

Describe how Rust enables cross-platform SIMD programming:

- What are the main crates and language features for SIMD in Rust?
- How does Rust ensure portability of SIMD code across different CPU architectures?
- Give an example of using a portable SIMD API in Rust.

🔧 **Task:** Provide a brief explanation and a code example using the `std::simd` or `packed_simd` API for portable SIMD.
