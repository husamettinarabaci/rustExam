#### ❓ Question 907: Combining SIMD with async workloads

Write a Rust program that demonstrates combining SIMD operations with async tasks:

- Create a large vector of `f32` values.
- Use an async function to split the vector into chunks and process each chunk in parallel using SIMD (e.g., multiply by 2.0).
- Collect and print the processed results.

🔧 **Task:** Use `tokio` for async execution and `packed_simd` or `std::simd` for SIMD processing within each async task.
