#### ❓ Question 908: Safety considerations in SIMD code

Explain the main safety considerations when writing SIMD code in Rust:

- What are the risks of using SIMD intrinsics or low-level APIs?
- How does Rust's type system and borrow checker help prevent common SIMD bugs?
- Give an example of a potential bug and how to avoid it.

🔧 **Task:** Provide a brief explanation and a code example showing a safe way to use SIMD in Rust.
