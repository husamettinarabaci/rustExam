#### ❓ Question 903: Vectorizing loops manually in Rust

Write a Rust function that manually vectorizes a loop to add two arrays of 16 `u32` values:

- Define two arrays of 16 `u32` numbers each.
- Use a loop to add them element-wise and store the result in a third array.
- Print the resulting array.

🔧 **Task:** Manually implement a loop to perform element-wise addition of two arrays and print the result.
