#### ❓ Question 909: Auto-vectorization and compiler flags

Explain how Rust's compiler can auto-vectorize code and which flags can be used to enable or improve vectorization:

- What is auto-vectorization?
- Which compiler flags help the optimizer generate SIMD instructions?
- Give an example of a loop that can be auto-vectorized and how to compile it for best performance.

🔧 **Task:** Provide a brief explanation, a code example, and the recommended `rustc` or `cargo` flags for enabling auto-vectorization.
