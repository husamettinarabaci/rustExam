#### ❓ Question 113: Nested enums and matches

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of nested enums and pattern matching:

- Define two enums, where one enum contains a variant that holds the other enum.
- Create an instance of the outer enum containing the inner enum.
- Use pattern matching to access and print the value inside the nested enums.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to define and use nested enums, and how to match on them to extract values.
