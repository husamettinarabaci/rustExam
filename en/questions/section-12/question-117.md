#### ❓ Question 117: Matching on nested enums

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to match on nested enums:

- Define two enums, where one enum contains the other as a variant.
- Create an instance of the outer enum containing the inner enum.
- Use a `match` statement to access values from both levels of enums.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use pattern matching to destructure and handle nested enums.
