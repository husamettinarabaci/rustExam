#### ❓ Question 119: Matching with ref and mut

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use `ref` and `mut` in pattern matching:

- Create a mutable variable of type `Option<i32>`.
- Use a `match` statement to match on the variable and obtain a reference to the value using `ref`.
- Use another `match` to obtain a mutable reference using `ref mut` and modify the value.
- Print the results before and after modification.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `ref` and `ref mut` in pattern matching to access and modify values inside enums.
