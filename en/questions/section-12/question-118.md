#### ❓ Question 118: Matching with while let

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use `while let` for enum matching:

- Create a mutable `Option<i32>` variable with an initial value.
- Use a `while let` loop to repeatedly extract and print the value, setting the variable to `None` after each iteration.
- Show how the loop exits when the value is `None`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `while let` for concise and repeated pattern matching with enums.
