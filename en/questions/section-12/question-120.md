#### ❓ Question 120: Matching with wildcard

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to use the wildcard pattern (`_`) in enum matching:

- Define an enum with at least three variants.
- Create a variable with one of the variants.
- Use a `match` statement to handle one specific variant and use `_` to match all other cases.
- Print different messages for the specific variant and the wildcard case.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use the wildcard pattern in a match statement to handle all other cases concisely.
