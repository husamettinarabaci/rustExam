#### ❓ Question 942: Using procedural macros for code introspection

Describe how procedural macros can be used for code introspection in Rust:

- Explain what procedural macros are and how they differ from declarative macros.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how a procedural macro can analyze Rust code at compile time (e.g., derive macro extracting field names).
- Discuss use cases and limitations of code introspection with procedural macros.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use a procedural macro to inspect or transform Rust code during compilation.
