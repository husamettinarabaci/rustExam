#### ❓ Question 941: Limitations of reflection in Rust

Explain the limitations of reflection in Rust:

- Define what reflection is and how it is used in other languages (e.g., Java, C#).
- Describe why Rust does not support runtime reflection in the same way.
- Discuss the trade-offs and how Rust achieves similar goals using other mechanisms (e.g., traits, macros).

🔧 **Task:** Summarize the main reasons why Rust does not have full runtime reflection and how developers work around this limitation.
