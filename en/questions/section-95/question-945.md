#### ❓ Question 945: Creating domain-specific attribute macros

Describe how to create attribute macros for domain-specific use cases in Rust:

- Explain what attribute macros are and how they differ from derive and function-like macros.
- Show, with code or pseudocode, how to implement a custom attribute macro for a specific domain (e.g., logging, validation).
- Discuss best practices and limitations when designing attribute macros for real-world projects.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to write and use a custom attribute macro for a domain-specific purpose in Rust.
