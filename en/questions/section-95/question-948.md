#### ❓ Question 948: Exploring experimental reflection crates

Describe the state of experimental reflection crates in Rust:

- List some crates that attempt to provide reflection capabilities (e.g., `inventory`, `traitobject`, `reflect`).
- Explain what features they offer and their limitations compared to runtime reflection in other languages.
- Discuss when and how these crates might be useful in Rust projects.

🔧 **Task:** Summarize the current landscape of experimental reflection crates in Rust and their practical applications.
