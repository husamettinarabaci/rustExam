#### ❓ Question 683: Creating hygienic macros to avoid name conflicts

Write a Rust macro that demonstrates macro hygiene:

- Define a macro that declares a local variable inside its expansion.
- Show that the macro does not interfere with variables of the same name outside the macro.
- Provide an example where the macro is used in a function with a variable of the same name.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate macro hygiene and how Rust macros avoid name conflicts.
