#### ❓ Question 686: Combining declarative macros with procedural macros

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to combine declarative (`macro_rules!`) and procedural macros:

- Define a simple `macro_rules!` macro for repetitive code.
- Use a procedural macro (such as `derive(Debug)`) on a struct generated by the declarative macro.
- Show how both macros work together in practice.

🔧 **Task:** Combine declarative and procedural macros in a single example.
