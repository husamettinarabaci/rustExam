#### ❓ Question 681: Writing `macro_rules!` macros for repetitive code

Write a Rust macro using `macro_rules!` to eliminate repetitive code:

- Define a macro that generates getter methods for struct fields.
- Demonstrate its use by applying it to a struct with at least two fields.
- Show how the generated getters work in practice.

🔧 **Task:** Use `macro_rules!` to reduce boilerplate by generating repetitive code automatically.
