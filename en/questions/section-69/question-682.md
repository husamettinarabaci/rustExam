#### ❓ Question 682: Using repetition, pattern matching, and metavariables

Write a Rust macro using `macro_rules!` that demonstrates repetition, pattern matching, and metavariables:

- Create a macro that takes a list of identifiers and generates a tuple struct with those fields.
- Show how the macro expands for different numbers of fields.
- Provide an example of using the generated struct.

🔧 **Task:** Use macro repetition and metavariables to generate flexible code structures.
