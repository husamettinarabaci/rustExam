#### ❓ Question 685: Recursive macros and complex pattern matching

Write a Rust macro using `macro_rules!` that demonstrates recursion and complex pattern matching:

- Define a macro that counts the number of arguments passed to it.
- Use recursion in the macro to process each argument.
- Show how the macro works with different numbers of arguments.

🔧 **Task:** Implement a recursive macro to count arguments using pattern matching.
