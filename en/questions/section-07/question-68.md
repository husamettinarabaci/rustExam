#### ❓ Question 68: Multiple immutable references

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the rules for multiple immutable references:

- Create a variable and obtain several immutable references to it.
- Show that you can have multiple immutable references at the same time.
- Attempt to create a mutable reference while immutable references are active and observe the compiler error.
- Optionally, show how scopes affect reference rules.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate Rust's borrowing rules for immutable and mutable references, including restrictions and how to use scopes to manage references.
