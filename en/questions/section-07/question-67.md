#### ❓ Question 67: Mutable references and borrowing rules

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the rules of mutable references:

- Create a variable and obtain a mutable reference to it.
- Show that you cannot have more than one mutable reference to the same variable at the same time.
- Attempt to create a second mutable reference and observe the compiler error.
- Optionally, show how to use scopes to allow multiple mutable references at different times.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate Rust's borrowing rules for mutable references, including restrictions and how to work around them using scopes.
