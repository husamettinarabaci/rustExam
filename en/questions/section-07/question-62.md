#### ❓ Question 62: Move semantics with variables

Write a Rust program that demonstrates move semantics with variables.

- Create a variable with a value (e.g., a `String`).
- Move the value to another variable by assignment.
- Attempt to use the original variable after the move and observe the compiler error.

🔧 **Task:** Show how move semantics work in Rust when assigning ownership from one variable to another.
