#### ❓ Question 69: Reference scope and lifetimes

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how the scope of references affects their lifetimes:

- Create a variable and obtain references to it in different scopes.
- Show that references are only valid within their scope.
- Attempt to use a reference outside its scope and observe the compiler error.
- Optionally, explain how Rust prevents dangling references using lifetimes.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate how reference scope and lifetimes work in Rust, and how the compiler enforces safety by preventing invalid references.
