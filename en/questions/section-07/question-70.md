#### ❓ Question 70: Dangling references and prevention

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how Rust prevents dangling references:

- Attempt to create a reference to a variable that goes out of scope.
- Observe the compiler error that prevents a dangling reference.
- Show a correct way to use references without causing dangling references.
- Optionally, explain why preventing dangling references is important for memory safety.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate how Rust's borrow checker prevents dangling references and ensures memory safety.
