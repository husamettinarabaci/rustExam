#### ❓ Question 66: Borrowing with references

Write a Rust function that borrows a value using a reference.

- Define a function that takes a reference to a `String` as a parameter.
- Call the function with a `String` variable without transferring ownership.
- Show that the original variable can still be used after the function call.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how borrowing with references works in Rust.
