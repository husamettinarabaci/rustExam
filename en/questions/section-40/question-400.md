#### ❓ Question 400: Using `Cow<str>` for borrowed or owned string data

Write a Rust program that:

- Uses `std::borrow::Cow<str>` to represent either a borrowed or owned string.
- Demonstrates a function that returns a `Cow<str>` depending on whether the input needs to be modified.
- Prints the result and shows whether it is borrowed or owned.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `Cow<str>` for flexible string ownership in Rust.
