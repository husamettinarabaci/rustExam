#### ❓ Question 399: Handling invalid UTF-8 from external input

Write a Rust program that:

- Attempts to create a string from a byte array that may not be valid UTF-8.
- Handles the error gracefully if the input is invalid.
- Prints a message indicating whether the conversion succeeded or failed.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to handle invalid UTF-8 when converting bytes to strings in Rust.
