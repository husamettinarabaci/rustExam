#### ❓ Question 930: Testing real-time embedded systems

Describe how to test real-time embedded systems in Rust.

- Explain the challenges of testing real-time systems (e.g., timing, determinism).
- List strategies and tools for effective testing (e.g., hardware-in-the-loop, simulation, property-based testing).
- Optionally, mention Rust crates or frameworks that support embedded testing.

🔧 **Task:** Summarize best practices and tools for testing real-time embedded systems in Rust.
