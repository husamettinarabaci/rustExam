#### ❓ Question 923: Implementing inter-task communication

Describe how to implement inter-task communication (ITC) in embedded Rust systems.

- Explain why ITC is important in embedded OSes.
- List common ITC mechanisms (e.g., message queues, channels, shared memory).
- Optionally, provide a simple Rust example using a channel or queue for communication between tasks.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to enable safe and efficient communication between tasks in embedded Rust.
