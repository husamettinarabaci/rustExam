#### ❓ Question 929: Debugging embedded OS kernels

Explain how to debug embedded OS kernels in Rust.

- List common debugging techniques (e.g., semihosting, RTT, serial output, hardware debuggers).
- Describe how Rust's tooling (e.g., `probe-rs`, `defmt`) can help.
- Optionally, provide a simple example of kernel debugging output.

🔧 **Task:** Summarize effective strategies for debugging embedded OS kernels in Rust.
