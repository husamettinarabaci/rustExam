#### ❓ Question 707: Tracking dynamic borrow lifetimes with `Ref` and `RefMut`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Use `RefCell<T>` to borrow a value as both immutable (`Ref`) and mutable (`RefMut`).
- Show the scope and lifetime of each borrow in code.
- Explain how dynamic borrow lifetimes work.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example showing how the scope of borrows is managed and tracked dynamically with `Ref` and `RefMut`.
