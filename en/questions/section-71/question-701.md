#### ❓ Question 701: Building a cyclic graph with `Rc<RefCell<T>>`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a cyclic (self-referential) graph data structure using `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.
- Ensure at least two nodes reference each other to form a cycle.
- Clearly demonstrate in code how the cycle is created.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example that shows how to create cyclic references using ownership and interior mutability.
