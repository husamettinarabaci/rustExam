#### ❓ Question 705: Demonstrating aliasing with `Rc` and `RefCell`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Use `Rc<RefCell<T>>` to create multiple references (aliases) to the same data.
- Show accessing and mutating the data through different references.
- Explain how aliasing works and its potential dangers.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example showing how aliasing is possible with `Rc` and `RefCell`, and what to watch out for.
