#### ❓ Question 702: Breaking reference cycles with `Weak<T>`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a cyclic graph using `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.
- Use `Weak<T>` for some links to prevent reference cycles.
- Clearly demonstrate in code how `Weak` breaks the cycle.

🔧 **Task:** Provide an example showing how to prevent reference cycles using `Weak<T>`.
