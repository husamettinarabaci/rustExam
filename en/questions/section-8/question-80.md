#### ❓ Question 80: Lifetime in trait objects

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use lifetimes with trait objects:

- Define a trait and a struct that holds a reference to a trait object, requiring a lifetime annotation.
- Implement the trait for a concrete type.
- Show how to create an instance of the struct with a trait object reference.
- Demonstrate usage in `main`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to specify lifetimes for references to trait objects in struct fields and usage.
