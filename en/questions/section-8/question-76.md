#### ❓ Question 76: Lifetime in function return values

Write a Rust function that returns a reference and requires a lifetime annotation in its return type:

- Implement a function that takes a string slice reference and returns a reference to its first word.
- Annotate the function with the correct lifetime parameter for both the input and output references.
- Demonstrate usage in `main` by printing the first word of a string.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use lifetime annotations in a function that returns a reference derived from its input.
