#### ❓ Question 79: Lifetime in generic structs

Write a Rust generic struct that includes a reference field and uses both a lifetime and a type parameter:

- Define a struct with a generic type parameter and a reference field that requires a lifetime annotation.
- Implement a method for the struct that returns the referenced value.
- Demonstrate usage in `main` with a concrete type (e.g., `i32`).

🔧 **Task:** Show how to combine lifetime and generic type parameters in a struct definition and method.
