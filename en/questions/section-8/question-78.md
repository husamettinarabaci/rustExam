#### ❓ Question 78: Lifetime in closures

Write a Rust closure that captures a reference and demonstrate how lifetimes affect closure usage:

- Define a string variable in `main`.
- Create a closure that borrows the string and returns its length.
- Show how the closure's lifetime is tied to the borrowed reference.
- Explain what happens if the string goes out of scope before the closure is used.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how lifetimes work with closures that capture references.
