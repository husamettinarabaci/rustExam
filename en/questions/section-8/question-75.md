#### ❓ Question 75: Lifetime errors and fixes

Write a Rust function that returns a reference to the larger of two string slices, and demonstrate a lifetime error:

- Implement a function that takes two string slice references and returns the longer one.
- First, write the function without lifetime annotations and observe the compiler error.
- Then, fix the error by adding the correct lifetime annotations.

🔧 **Task:** Show a common lifetime error and how to resolve it using explicit lifetime parameters in function signatures.
