#### ❓ Question 893: Parsing an expression language using recursive descent

Do the following:

- Write a recursive descent parser function to parse simple arithmetic expressions (e.g., "2 + 3 * 4").
- Use a vector of tokens to build an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- Parse the expression 2 + 3 * 4 and show the resulting AST.

🔧 **Task:** Write a parser that recursively builds an AST from tokens.
