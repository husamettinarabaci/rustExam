#### ❓ Question 713: Understanding lifetime elision rules and when to annotate manually

Write a Rust function that does the following:

- Provide an example where lifetime elision rules work automatically.
- Rewrite the same function for a case where elision is insufficient and manual annotation is needed.
- Show how the function behaves in both cases.

🔧 **Task:** Create an example demonstrating when lifetime elision is sufficient and when explicit annotation is required.
