#### ❓ Question 712: Using multiple lifetimes in function signatures

Write a Rust function that does the following:

- Accepts two reference parameters with different lifetimes.
- Specify two different lifetimes in the function signature and show which lifetime the returned reference is tied to.
- Provide an example showing how the lifetimes work.

🔧 **Task:** Create an example demonstrating a function with multiple lifetime parameters and how to use it.
