#### ❓ Question 641: Using compiler flags for optimization (`-C opt-level`)

Write a Rust program and compile it using different optimization levels:

- Create a simple Rust program that performs a basic computation (e.g., sum numbers in a loop).
- Compile and run the program with different `-C opt-level` flags (0, 1, 2, 3, s, z).
- Observe and compare the performance or binary size.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use Rust compiler optimization flags and explain their effects.
