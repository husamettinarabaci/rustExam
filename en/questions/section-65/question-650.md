#### ❓ Question 650: Writing cache-friendly data structures

Write a Rust program that demonstrates cache-friendly vs. cache-unfriendly data structures:

- Implement a data structure with good cache locality (e.g., array of structs) and one with poor locality (e.g., linked list).
- Benchmark or discuss the performance difference.
- Explain why cache-friendly design matters.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to design and implement cache-friendly data structures in Rust.
