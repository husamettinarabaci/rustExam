#### ❓ Question 649: Avoiding lock contention in multithreaded code

Write a Rust program that demonstrates lock contention:

- Create a multithreaded program using `Mutex` or `RwLock`.
- Show how lock contention can degrade performance.
- Refactor the code to reduce contention (e.g., sharding, lock-free structures).

🔧 **Task:** Practice techniques to avoid lock contention in concurrent Rust code.
