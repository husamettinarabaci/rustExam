#### ❓ Question 648: Using SIMD instructions with `packed_simd`

Write a Rust program that uses SIMD for performance:

- Use the `packed_simd` crate to perform vectorized computations (e.g., sum or multiply arrays).
- Compare the performance to a scalar implementation.
- Discuss the benefits and limitations of SIMD in Rust.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use SIMD instructions in Rust for optimization.
