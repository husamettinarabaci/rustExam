#### ❓ Question 646: Memory layout optimizations with `#[repr]`

Write a Rust program that demonstrates the use of `#[repr(C)]` and `#[repr(packed)]`:

- Define a struct with and without `#[repr(C)]` or `#[repr(packed)]`.
- Use `std::mem::size_of` to compare their memory layouts.
- Discuss when and why to use these attributes for optimization.

🔧 **Task:** Show how memory layout attributes can optimize Rust data structures.
