#### ❓ Question 645: Inline annotations and function call overhead

Write a Rust program to measure the effect of function inlining:

- Create a function with and without the `#[inline]` and `#[inline(always)]` attributes.
- Benchmark or inspect the generated assembly to see the effect on function call overhead.
- Explain when inlining is beneficial.

🔧 **Task:** Explore how inline annotations affect performance in Rust.
