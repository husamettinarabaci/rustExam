#### ❓ Question 643: Identifying and eliminating unnecessary allocations

Write a Rust program that demonstrates unnecessary heap allocations:

- Create a function that allocates memory in a loop (e.g., creates new `Vec`s or `String`s).
- Refactor the code to minimize or eliminate unnecessary allocations.
- Compare the performance before and after optimization.

🔧 **Task:** Practice identifying and removing unnecessary allocations in Rust code.
