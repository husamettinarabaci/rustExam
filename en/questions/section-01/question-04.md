#### ❓ Question 4: Using variable shadowing in Rust

Write a Rust program that demonstrates variable shadowing:

- Declare a variable `x` and assign it a value.
- Shadow `x` by declaring it again with a new value.
- Print both values of `x` (before and after shadowing) to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Use variable shadowing to update the value of `x` and explain the concept in your code comments.
