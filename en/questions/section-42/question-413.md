#### ❓ Question 413: Iterating over a vector by value, reference, and mutably

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a `Vec<i32>` and add some numbers to it.
- Show examples of iterating over the vector by value, by reference, and by mutable reference.
- Print the elements to the terminal in each method.

🔧 **Task:** Write Rust code that demonstrates different ways to iterate over a Vec.
