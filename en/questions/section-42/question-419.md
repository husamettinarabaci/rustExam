#### ❓ Question 419: Combining iterators and collections for filtering

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Create a `Vec<i32>` and add some numbers to it.
- Use an iterator and `filter` to create a new vector containing only even numbers.
- Print the result to the terminal.

🔧 **Task:** Write Rust code that demonstrates filtering a collection using iterators and filter.
