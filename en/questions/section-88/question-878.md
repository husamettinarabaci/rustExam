#### ❓ Question 878: Secure networking with TLS and Rustls

Follow these steps to implement a secure TCP server and client using TLS in Rust:

- Use crates like `rustls` and `tokio-rustls` to create a TLS-enabled server and client.
- Use a self-signed certificate on the server side.
- Exchange encrypted data between client and server.
- Demonstrate certificate validation and error handling.

🔧 **Task:** Establish a secure TCP connection with TLS in Rust and exchange data.
