#### ❓ Question 107: Enum with tuple variants

Write a Rust program that demonstrates an enum with tuple variants:

- Define an enum `Shape` with two tuple variants: `Circle(f64)` and `Rectangle(f64, f64)`.
- Create a function that takes a `Shape` and returns its area as `f64`.
- In `main`, create a `Circle` and a `Rectangle`, and print their areas.

🔧 **Task:** Use tuple variants in an enum and pattern match to calculate and print the area for each shape.
