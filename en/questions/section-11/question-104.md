#### ❓ Question 104: Using `match` with enums and printing

Write a Rust program that uses a `match` statement to print messages based on enum variants.

- Define an enum with at least two variants (one may carry data).
- Create a variable of this enum type and assign it a value.
- Use a `match` statement to print a different message for each variant.

🔧 **Task:** Define an enum, create an instance, and use `match` to print messages for each variant.
