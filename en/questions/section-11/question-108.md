#### ❓ Question 108: Enum with struct variants

Write a Rust program that demonstrates an enum with struct variants:

- Define an enum `Message` with two struct variants: `Move { x: i32, y: i32 }` and `Write { text: String }`.
- Create a function that takes a `Message` and prints a message based on its variant.
- In `main`, create both variants and call the function for each.

🔧 **Task:** Use struct variants in an enum and pattern match to handle each variant differently.
