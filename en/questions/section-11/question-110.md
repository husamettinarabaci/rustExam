#### ❓ Question 110: Enum with associated functions

Write a Rust program that demonstrates an enum with associated functions:

- Define an enum `Color` with variants: `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`.
- Implement an associated function `from_str` that takes a string and returns a `Color`.
- In `main`, use `from_str` to create a `Color` from a string and print which color it is.

🔧 **Task:** Implement an associated function for an enum to construct it from a string value.
