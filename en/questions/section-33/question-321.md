#### ❓ Question 321: Propagating errors with the `?` operator

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Perform an operation in a function that can fail (e.g., open a file or parse a string to a number).
- Use the `?` operator to propagate errors to the caller.
- Write a main function (or similar) that demonstrates error propagation.
- Show both a successful and a failing scenario in your code.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate error propagation and chaining using the `?` operator.
