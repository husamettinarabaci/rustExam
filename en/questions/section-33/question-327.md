#### ❓ Question 327: Chaining fallible operations with combinators like map_err

Write a Rust function that demonstrates how to chain multiple fallible operations using combinators such as `map`, `and_then`, and `map_err` on `Result` types.

- Implement a function that parses a string to an integer and then doubles it.
- Use `map_err` to convert the error into a custom error message.
- Show how to chain these operations in a concise way.

🔧 **Task:** Use combinators like `map`, `and_then`, and `map_err` to handle and transform errors in a functional style.
