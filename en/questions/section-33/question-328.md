#### ❓ Question 328: Using anyhow for simple application-level error handling

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use the `anyhow` crate to simplify error handling at the application level.

- Define a function that chains multiple fallible operations (e.g., reading a file and parsing a number).
- Use `anyhow::Result` and the `?` operator to propagate errors.
- Write a `main` function that displays error messages to the user.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example application that uses the anyhow crate to simplify error handling with chained operations.
