#### ❓ Question 330: Logging or reporting errors without panicking

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Define a function that can fail (e.g., reading a file or parsing a number).
- When an error occurs, log the error or print a meaningful message to the user instead of panicking.
- Use `Result` and appropriate error handling techniques.

🔧 **Task:** Use `match`, `if let`, or `unwrap_or_else` to handle errors gracefully, inform the user, and allow the program to continue safely.
