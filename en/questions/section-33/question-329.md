#### ❓ Question 329: Using thiserror to derive error enums

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use the `thiserror` crate to easily define and manage custom error enums.

- Define an enum representing multiple error cases and derive `thiserror::Error` for it.
- Use descriptive error messages for each variant.
- Write a function that returns `Result<T, E>` using this error type.
- Include an example application that displays errors to the user.

🔧 **Task:** Write an example showing how to derive error enums with thiserror and use them in functions.
