#### ❓ Question 762: Writing interrupt service routines (ISRs) safely

What is an interrupt service routine (ISR) in Rust and how do you write one safely for embedded systems?

- Explain the concept and importance of ISRs.
- Describe safety considerations when writing ISRs in Rust.
- Provide a simple ISR example (e.g., a function called when a GPIO pin changes).

🔧 **Task:** Show how to write a safe ISR in Rust with an example.
