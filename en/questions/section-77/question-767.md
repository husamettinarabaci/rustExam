#### ❓ Question 767: Implementing communication protocols (I2C, SPI, UART)

How are communication protocols like I2C, SPI, or UART implemented in embedded Rust?

- Explain the basic differences and use cases of these protocols.
- Provide an example of implementing one protocol (e.g., I2C) in Rust.
- Describe the role of the hardware abstraction layer (HAL).

🔧 **Task:** Show a basic implementation of a communication protocol and HAL usage in embedded Rust.
