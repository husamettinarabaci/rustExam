#### ❓ Question 772: Multithreaded entity update systems

Write Rust code that does the following:

- Set up the basics of a multithreaded entity update system for a game engine.
- Create a vector of entities and define a function to update each entity's state.
- Perform entity updates in parallel by splitting the work across multiple threads (for example, using `std::thread` or `rayon`).
- Each thread should update its own subset of entities.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate the core logic of parallel entity updates in Rust by building a simple multithreaded update system.
