#### ❓ Question 773: Networked multiplayer synchronization

Write Rust code that does the following:

- Set up a basic networked multiplayer synchronization logic.
- Create a data structure to represent player positions.
- Write a function that updates the positions of multiple players and sends these updates to a "server" (you may simulate this with TCP/UDP or channels).
- The server should receive position updates and broadcast them to other players (simulation is sufficient).

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate the basics of multiplayer synchronization in Rust, including data sharing and update propagation.
