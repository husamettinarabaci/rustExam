#### ❓ Question 1341: Designing service boundaries and contracts

Write Rust code that models service boundaries and contracts in a microservices architecture:

- Define structs for two separate services with different responsibilities.
- Specify each service's interface using a trait.
- Simulate inter-service communication with a function.

🔧 **Task:** Model service boundaries and interface contracts using traits and structs.
