#### ❓ Question 438: Preventing memory leaks with `Weak<T>`

Write a Rust example and explanation that demonstrates:

- How reference cycles can cause memory leaks with `Rc<T>`.
- How to use `Weak<T>` to break cycles and prevent leaks.
- A simple example of a cyclic data structure and how `Weak<T>` solves the problem.

🔧 **Task:** Show how `Weak<T>` prevents memory leaks in reference-counted data structures.
