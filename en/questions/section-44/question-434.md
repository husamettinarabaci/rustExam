#### ❓ Question 434: Combining `Rc<RefCell<T>>` in data structures

Write a Rust example and explanation that demonstrates:

- How to combine `Rc<T>` and `RefCell<T>` for shared, mutable data.
- Why this pattern is useful in single-threaded scenarios.
- A simple example of a data structure (like a tree) using `Rc<RefCell<T>>`.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to use `Rc<RefCell<T>>` for shared, mutable ownership in a data structure.
