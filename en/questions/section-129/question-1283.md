#### ❓ Question 1283: Interfacing with JavaScript and DOM APIs

Follow these steps to interact with JavaScript and DOM APIs from your Rust WASM module:

- Use `wasm-bindgen` to expose Rust functions to JS.
- Use `web-sys` or `js-sys` in Rust to manipulate the DOM.
- Change the content of an HTML element from Rust.
- Call a Rust function from JS and update the DOM.

🔧 **Task:** Write a Rust WASM function that manipulates the DOM and demonstrate its interaction with JS.
