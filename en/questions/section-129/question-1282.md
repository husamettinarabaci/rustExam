#### ❓ Question 1282: Using `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-pack`

Follow these steps to compile a Rust project to WebAssembly and enable JS interop:

- Add the `wasm-bindgen` crate to your frontend project.
- Use the `wasm-pack` tool to build the project as WASM.
- Write a Rust function (e.g., returning a message) that can be called from JS.
- Use the compiled WASM module in an HTML file.

🔧 **Task:** Use `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-pack` to compile Rust code to WASM and enable JS interop.
