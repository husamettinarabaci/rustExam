#### ❓ Question 1281: Setting up a fullstack Rust+WASM project

Follow these steps to set up a fullstack Rust and WebAssembly (WASM) project:

- Use Rust for both backend (e.g., Axum, Actix-Web) and frontend (e.g., Yew, Leptos).
- Compile the frontend code to WASM.
- Create the project structure and essential files.
- Add necessary dependencies and provide a basic "Hello, WASM!" output.

🔧 **Task:** Create a fullstack project skeleton with both backend and frontend, using Rust and WASM.
