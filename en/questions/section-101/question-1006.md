#### ❓ Question 1006: Delays and timeouts with `tokio::time`

Write a Rust program that does the following:

- Wait for a specific duration in an async function (`tokio::time::sleep`).
- Use `tokio::time::timeout` to check if an operation completes within a given time.
- Print a message if a timeout occurs.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate delay and timeout management using Tokio's timing utilities.
