#### ❓ Question 442: Lifetime annotations for structs holding references

Define a struct that holds a reference to a string slice. Add the necessary lifetime annotation to the struct definition and its field.

- Create a struct with a field that is a reference to a `str`.
- Annotate the struct with a lifetime parameter.
- Demonstrate how to instantiate the struct with a string slice.

🔧 **Task:** Use lifetime annotations to ensure the struct can safely hold a reference.
