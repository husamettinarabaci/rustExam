#### ❓ Question 444: Writing functions that return references

Write a function that takes a reference to an integer and returns a reference to the same integer. Use explicit lifetime annotations.

- Define a function that accepts a reference to an `i32`.
- Return a reference to the same `i32`.
- Use explicit lifetime annotations in the function signature.

🔧 **Task:** Ensure the returned reference is valid for the lifetime of the input reference.
