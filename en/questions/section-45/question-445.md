#### ❓ Question 445: Nested lifetimes and struct methods

Define a struct with a reference field and implement a method that returns a reference to that field. Use appropriate lifetime annotations for both the struct and the method.

- Create a struct with a reference field and a lifetime parameter.
- Implement a method that returns a reference to the field.
- Use explicit lifetime annotations in the method signature.

🔧 **Task:** Demonstrate how to use lifetimes in both struct and method definitions.
