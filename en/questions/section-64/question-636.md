#### ❓ Question 636: Using `futures` crate combinators extensively

Show how to use combinators from the `futures` crate to compose and manipulate async computations.

- Demonstrate chaining, mapping, and error handling with combinators.
- Provide examples using `map`, `then`, `and_then`, or similar methods.
- Explain the benefits of combinator-based async code.

🔧 **Task:** Write code that chains multiple async operations using combinators from the `futures` crate.
