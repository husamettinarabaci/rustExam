#### ❓ Question 631: Exploring how async/await works under the hood

Explain how Rust's `async`/`await` syntax is transformed by the compiler. 

- Describe what happens when you write an `async fn` or use an `async` block.
- Discuss the role of the `Future` trait and how state machines are generated.
- Optionally, provide a simple example showing the desugaring process.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate the transformation of async code into state machines and how the `Future` trait is involved.
