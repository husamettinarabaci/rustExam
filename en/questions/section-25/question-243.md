#### ❓ Question 243: Mutating Captured Variables in Closures

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how a closure can mutate a captured variable:

- Define a mutable variable in the main function.
- Create a mutable closure that increments the variable.
- Call the closure multiple times and print the variable after each call.

🔧 **Task:** Practice how closures can mutate variables they capture in Rust using `mut` and mutable references.
