#### ❓ Question 244: Returning Closures from Functions

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how to return a closure from a function:

- Use the returned closure to add different numbers and print the results.

🔧 **Task:** Practice returning closures from functions using `impl Fn` or `Box<dyn Fn>` in Rust.
