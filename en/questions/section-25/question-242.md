#### ❓ Question 242: Closure Capture by Value (`move`)

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how a closure can capture variables by value using the `move` keyword:

- Define a variable in the main function.
- Create a closure that captures this variable by value using `move` and prints it.
- Call the closure.
- Modify the original variable after the closure is created and show that the closure still prints the old value.

🔧 **Task:** Practice how closures capture and use variables by value with the `move` keyword in Rust.
