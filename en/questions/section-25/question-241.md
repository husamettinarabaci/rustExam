#### ❓ Question 241: Closure Capture by Reference

Write a Rust program that demonstrates how a closure can capture variables by reference:

- Define a variable in the main function.
- Create a closure that prints the value of this variable (by reference).
- Call the closure.
- After calling the closure, modify the variable and call the closure again.

🔧 **Task:** Practice how closures capture and use variables by reference in Rust.
