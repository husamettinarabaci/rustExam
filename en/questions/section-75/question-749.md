#### ❓ Question 749: Comparing `Pin`-based APIs to regular borrowed references

Explain the differences between APIs that use `Pin` (e.g., `Pin<&mut T>`) and those that use regular borrowed references (`&mut T`).

- Discuss when and why you would use `Pin` over a normal reference.
- Provide a code example showing both approaches.
- Comment on the safety guarantees provided by each.

🔧 **Task:** Compare the use cases and safety of `Pin`-based APIs versus regular borrowed references in Rust.
