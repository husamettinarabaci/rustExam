#### ❓ Question 748: Implementing a self-referential future using `Pin`

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to implement a self-referential `Future` using `Pin`.

- Define a struct that implements `Future` and is self-referential.
- Use `Pin` to ensure the struct is not moved after being polled.
- Show how to poll the future safely.

🔧 **Task:** Show how to safely implement a self-referential async future in Rust using pinning.
