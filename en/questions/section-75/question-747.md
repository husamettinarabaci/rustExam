#### ❓ Question 747: Using `pin_project` or `pin-utils` to reduce boilerplate

Write a Rust example that demonstrates how to use the `pin_project` or `pin-utils` crate to safely implement a self-referential type with less boilerplate.

- Add the `pin-project` crate to your dependencies.
- Use the `#[pin_project]` attribute to define a self-referential struct.
- Show how to safely access pinned fields.

🔧 **Task:** Show how external crates can help reduce boilerplate when working with pinned/self-referential types.
