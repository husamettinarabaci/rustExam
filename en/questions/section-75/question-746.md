#### ❓ Question 746: Demonstrating incorrect `Pin` usage and undefined behavior scenarios

Write a Rust example that shows what can go wrong if you use `Pin` incorrectly (e.g., by moving a pinned value unsafely).

- Create a struct that should not be moved after being pinned.
- Use unsafe code to move the pinned value and explain the consequences.
- Comment on why this leads to undefined behavior.

🔧 **Task:** Illustrate the dangers of misusing `Pin` and how it can result in undefined behavior.
